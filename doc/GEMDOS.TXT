             This is the Atari GEMDOS User's Manual.   It  describes
        the  internals  and  use  of  GEMDOS  on the Atari ST.  This
        manual is divided into three parts; a tutorial and introduc-
        tion for beginning users, a reference manual for application
        writers, and appendices for GEMDOS wizards.

             The GEMDOS Tutorial is a  gentle  introduction  to  the
        basics  of  GEMDOS.  Its intention is to get beginning users
        started as quickly as possible.  It gives example  programs,
        designed  to  exercise  most of GEMDOS, which combine into a
        simple commandline interface, or "shell".  The tutorial also
        covers common pitfalls and useful shortcuts.

             The GEMDOS Reference Manual is the application-writer's
        bible.  It covers GEMDOS' calling conventions, file and han-
        dle manipulation, process execution, and every GEMDOS call.

             The Appendices contain nitty-gritty details  and  hints
        for  those  who  have to push GEMDOS to the limit.  They are
        for application writers (and the merely  curious)  who  have
        "need to know" about obscurities in the system.

             To use this manual effectively readers should be  fami-
        liar  with  C and 68000 assembly language.  Familiarity with
        MSDOS, Unix[1], and the standard C runtime library will also
        help.

             GEMDOS uses the Alcyon (or Digital Research) C  calling
        conventions.   Note  that  these conventions may differ from
        other 68000 C compilers.  If you are using  another  C  com-
        piler  it  might  not  be  possible to call GEMDOS directly;
        please check your compiler's documentation  for  compatibil-
        ity.

             Arguments are pushed on the stack, in reverse order  of
        their  declaration.   The  GEMDOS  function number is pushed
        last, as a WORD.  To do the call to GEMDOS,  a  68000  "TRAP
        #1"  instruction is executed.  The trap can be made with the
        68000 in user or supervisor mode.

        NOTE
                  Applications running in  supervisor  mode  may  be
                  forced  back into user mode after making a GEM AES
                  call.

             Results are returned in D0.  Registers D0-D2 and  A0-A2
        can  be  modified;  registers D3-D7 and A3-A7 will always be
        preserved.  The caller is responsible for popping the  argu-
        ments (including the function number) off of the stack after
        the call.

             The Alcyon C compiler does not generate  TRAP  instruc-
        tions,  so  most  applications use a small assembly-language
        binding.  It typically looks like:

        _F_I_L_E_N_A_M_E_S
             A filename consists of a drive  specification  followed
        by  a pathname and a simple filename.  A drive specification
        consists of a single letter, A  through  P,  followed  by  a
        colon; if the specification is missing, the default drive is
        used.  A pathname consists of a  list  of  simple  filenames
        separated  with  backslashes.  If the pathname starts with a
        backslash it is anchored in the root directory, otherwise it
        is  anchored  in  the current directory.  If the pathname is
        missing, the current directory is used.  A  simple  filename
        consists  of one to eight characters, optionally followed by
        a period and zero to three more characters.

             Legal characters in filenames and pathnames include the
        alphabet   (A-Z),   digits   (0-9),  and  most  punctuation.
        Periods,  colons,  backslashes,   slashes,   question-marks,
        asterisks,  control characters (including NULs), and charac-
        ters greater  than  0x7f  may  never  appear  in  filenames.
        Lowercase letters are converted to uppercase.

             A full file specification may not  exceed  125  charac-
        ters.

             In a pathname, "." refers to the current directory  and
        ".."  refers  to  the  current directory's parent directory.
        Thus, the paths:

                                "..\..\foo"
        and
                       ".\.\.\.\.\.\..\.\.\..\.\foo"

        refer to the same file two directories up from  the  current
        one.  (There is no parent directory at the root.)

             There are three  character  devices.   Only  the  calls
        Fread(),  Fwrite() Fopen(), Fcreate(), and Fclose(), and the
        standard I/O functions work on them:

             An Fopen() or Fcreate() call on one  of  the  character
        devices  will  return a character device handle.  The handle
        is WORD negative, but not LONG negative.

        ~/text/gemdos/fileops               File Operations    ( 1 )


        _F_I_L_E _O_P_E_R_A_T_I_O_N_S
             GEMDOS places no restrictions on what a file  may  con-
        tain.   Most  applications  assume  that  text files contain
        lines  separated  with  carriage-return  linefeeds,  with  a
        control-Z indicating the end of file.  The format of execut-
        able files is documented in the Appendix.

             The GEMDOS calls Fcreate() and  Fopen()  return  small,
        positive 16-bit integers, called handles, that refer to open
        files.  A file may be opened for reading only,  for  writing
        only, or for reading and writing.  Closing the file relinqu-
        ishes the handle, allowing the handle to be re-used.

             There are three kinds  of  handles.   Standard  handles
        range  from  0  to  5, and may refer to character devices or
        files.  Non-standard handles start at 6, and refer  only  to
        files.   Character  handles refer only to character devices;
        the handle numbers range from 0xfffd to  0xffff,  which  are
        WORD negative, but not LONG negative.

             When a process does a Pexec() call  the  child  process
        inherits  the  parent's standard handles.  Handle 0 is often
        referred to as "standard input" or "standard  output";  nor-
        mally it is connected to the console, CON:.  With Fdup() and
        Fforce() calls it is possible to redirect a process's  stan-
        dard I/O to or from a file or another character device.

             When a media change occurs, all files open on the  disk
        that was removed are forced closed by GEMDOS.

        _B_U_G_S
                  There is no concept of "standard error" output.

        _P_R_O_C_E_S_S_E_S
             Although GEMDOS does not support  multitasking,  it  is
        possible  to  execute processes in a subroutine-like manner.
        A process may "call" another with Pexec(); the child process
        will terminate with a WORD return code.

             A process owns any files it opens  and  any  memory  it
        allocates.   Open files are closed and memory is deallocated
        when the process terminates.

             Before a process is  actually  terminated  GEMDOS  will
        call  extended  vector  0x102.   This allows applications to
        make a "last ditch" effort to recover from error conditions,
        or to deinstall themselves.

             The memory model used by GEMDOS is similar to  MSDOS's.
        A  process  runs  in  the TPA (Transient Program Area).  The
        first 0x100 bytes of the  TPA  is  the  process's  basepage,
        which contains process-specific information.

             `p_lowtpa'  points  to  the   basepage   (to   itself).
        `p_hitpa'  points  to the TPA's limit, to the first unusable
        location.  `p_tbase', `p_tlen' and so on contain the  start-
        ing  addresses and sizes of the text, data and BSS segments.
        `p_parent'  points  to  the   process's   parent   process's
        basepage.   `p_env'  points  to  the  enviroment string [see
        Pexec()].

             The first byte of the commandline  image  contains  the
        number of characters in the commandline.  The second through
        Nth bytes contain the image.  The image is _n_o_t guaranteed to
        be null-terminated.

             An application receives control at the starting address
        of  its  text  segment.   The  second longword on the stack,
        4(sp), will contain a pointer  to  the  process's  basepage.
        Normally  all  free memory is allocated to a new process; if
        the process is going to use Malloc() or Pexec() then it must
        relocate its stack and call Mshrink() to release memory back
        to the system.  The stack segment starts  near  the  highest
        TPA location and grows toward the BSS.

        eight _l_o_g_i_c_a_l vectors, numbered 0x100  through  0x107.   The
        absolute  locations  of the logical vectors is undefined; it
        is up to the BIOS to allocate storage for them.

        0x100 Timer Tick
                  This vector is called periodically  (at  50hz)  by
             the  BIOS  to  maintain  the  system's date/time-of-day
             clock and do  housekeeping.   The  first  word  on  the
             stack,  4(sp), contains the number of milliseconds from
             the last timer tick interrupt.

                  To intercept the timer vector, use the  BIOS  call
             to get and set the vector.  Each handler should execute
             its own code first, and then  follow  the  old  vector.
             Interrupt  handlers should be short and sweet; dawdling
             here will affect system performance.

                  All registers (except SP and USP) are modified  by
             GEMDOS.   The  BIOS  takes  responsibility  for  saving
             registers D0-D7/A0-A6; therefore  handlers  chained  to
             this  interrupt  do not have to save and restore regis-
             ters.

        0x101 Critical Error Handler
                  The Critical Error Handler is called by  the  BIOS
             to handle certain errors (rwabs() disk errors and media
             change requests.) It allows the application  to  handle
             the errors as it sees fit.

                  The first word on the stack, 4(sp),  is  an  error
             number.   Depending  on  the error, other arguments may
             also be on  the  stack.   The  critical  error  handler
             should   preserve   registers  D3-D7/A3-A6.   When  the
             handler returns, D0 contains a result code:

           |_______________|_________________________________________|

                  The default critical error handler simply  returns
             -1.

        0x102 Terminate (^C) Handler
                  Before a process is  actually  terminated,  GEMDOS
             calls  the  terminate  vector.  If the terminate vector
             points to an RTS (the default case), the  process  will
             be  terminated.  If the application does not wish to be
             terminated it should do a longjump (or its  equivalent)
             to an appropriate handler.

        thinking that a single drive system really has two drives.

                  Useless feature department: If the `read-only'  bit  is
             set,  a  write-only handle is returned, and the handle can't
             be written to.

                  Ideally, only one volume  label  is  permitted  in  the
             volume's  root  directory.   GEMDOS  doesn't  enforce  this,
             though, which could cause confusion.

             starts  executing at the base of its text segment, as speci-
             fied in the basepage.

                  Create-basepage will allocate the largest free block of
             memory and create most of a basepage for it.  (Some entries,
             most significantly the text/data/bss size and  base  values,
             are  NOT  setup -- the caller is responsible for maintaining
             them).

                  A child process inherits  the  parent's  standard  file
             descriptors;  effectively  doing  an  Fdup() and an Fforce()
             call on handles 0 through 5.

                  Since system resources are allocated when a basepage is
             created,  the spawned process MUST be terminated in order to
             release them.  This is especially important when using over-
             lays;  see  the  [Pexec cookbook] for details on use of Pex-
             ec().

             The  file  specification may contain wildcards (`?' and `*')
             in the simple filename, but not in the  path  specification.
             `attrib'  controls  which files are returned by Fsfirst; its
             format is described in the documentation on  `Fattrib()'.

                  If  `attrib'  is  zero,  then  only  normal  files  are
             searched for (no volume labels, hidden files, subdirectories
             or system files are returned).  If `attrib' is set for  hid-
             den  or  system  files, they are included in the search set.
             If `attrib' is set for volume labels, only volume labels are
             returned.

                  When a file is found, a 44-byte structure is written to
             the location pointed to by the DTA:

             The text and data segment images immediately follow the
        header.  The symbol table, if there is one, follows the data
        segment.

             GEMDOS will "fix up" a longword in  the  text  or  data
        segments by adding the base of the text segment to the value
        already in the longword.  The  fixup  list  specifies  which
        longwords need to be relocated.  The first item in the fixup
        list is a longword specifying the offset of the first fixup;

        the  longword  is  NULL (0L) if there are no fixups.  Single
        bytes following the longword specify offsets to more fixups.
        The  longwords  _m_u_s_t start on word boundaries, or the system
        will crash.

             GEMDOS uses the first few sectors of a disk to indicate
        where  files  are  stored.   A  volume usually contains five
        parts; an optional boot sector, two identical FAT tables,  a
        root directory, and a cluster area.

             When GEMDOS first accesses a  drive  (or  accesses  one
        after a media change), it makes a `GETBPB' (Get BIOS Parame-
        ter Block) BIOS call to determine how big these  areas  are,
        and  where  they  are  stored on the disk.  GETBPB returns a
        pointer to a nine-word structure.  From this structure, GEM-
        DOS  can puzzle out where the various parts of the file sys-
        tem are.

                 RECSIZ indicates the number of bytes per physi-
            cal  sector;  this must be 512 with the current GEM-
            DOS.  CLSIZ indicates the number  of  sectors  in  a
            cluster;  this  must  be  2  in  the current GEMDOS.
            CLSIZB is the number of bytes in  a  cluster,  which
            must be 1024.

                 RDLEN is the size of  the  root  directory,  in
            sectors.   A  directory  entry uses 32 bytes, so the
            number of root files available is RDLEN * 512 / 32.

                 FSIZ is the size of each FAT in  sectors.   FA-
            TREC is the starting sector number of the first sec-
            tor of the /second/ FAT.

                 DATREC is the starting  sector#  of  the  first
            cluster.   NUMCL  is  the  number of clusters on the
            device.

                 BFLAGS was  supposed  to  be  a  bit-vector  of
            flags.  Currently only bit 0 is being used; when set
            it indicates that 16-bit  FAT  entries  (instead  of
            12-bit ones) are to be used.

             If there are boot sectors, they occupy logical  sectors
        0  through  FATREC  -  FSIZ  -  1.  The second FAT starts at
        FATREC, and the first FAT starts at FATREC - FSIZ.  The root
        directory  starts  at  FATREC  + FSIZ, and the first cluster
        starts at DATREC.  The cluster region is where the data  for
        all files on the volume is kept.

             All WORDS and LONGS in the directory entry are in  8086
        "byte reversed" format.

             When a file is deleted, the  first  byte  of  the  name
        field is set to 0xe5.

             A  subdirectory  is  a  file  that  contains  directory
        entries.  The first two entries in a subdirectory are always
        the special directories "." and "..".

             The File Allocation Table (FAT)  is  used  to  allocate
        clusters  and  to  link  clusters  together into files.  FAT
        entries may be 12 or 16 bits.  A file's directory entry con-
        tains  the  number  of  the first cluster in the file.  Each
        cluster's associated FAT entry contains the  number  of  the
        next  cluster  in  the file, or a number that indicates end-
        of-file.

             For a 12-bit FAT, obtain the next cluster in the  file,
        NCL, given the current cluster number, CL, by:
           [1] (Multiply by 1.5)
               NCL = CL + CL / 2
           [2] Set NCL to the 16-bit word in the FAT indexed by  NCL
               (it  must  be  byte-swapped to 68000 format as well.)
               The word might not be on a 68000 word boundary.
           [3] (Extract the correct 12 bits.)
               If CL is odd, set NCL = NCL >> 4.

           [4] (Mask off incorrect bits.)
               Set NCL = NCL & 0x0FFF.
           [5] (Interpret the result.)
               If NCL is 0x0FF8 or higher,  then  CL  was  the  last
               cluster  in the file.  If NCL is zero or in the range
               0x0FF0 to 0x0FF7 then there is a file system problem.
               Otherwise,  NCL  is the number of the next cluster in
               the file.

             For a 16-bit FAT, obtain the next cluster in the  file,
        NCL, given the current cluster number, CL, by:
           [1] Set NCL to the 16-bit word in the FAT indexed by  CL.
               The word must be byte-swapped into 68000 format.
           [2] If NCL is 0xfff8 or higher,  then  CL  was  the  last
               cluster  in  the  file.   If NCL is 0 or in the range
               0x8000 to 0xfff7 then there is a file system problem.
               Otherwise,  NCL  is the number of the next cluster in
               the file.

             To convert from a cluster number, CL, to a logical sec-
        tor number, LSN:
           [1] (Adjust for reserved FAT entries.)
               LSN = CL - 2
           [2] Multiply LSN by the number  of  sectors  per  cluster
               (CLSIZ).
           [3] Add the logical sector# of the first cluster  to  LSN
               (DATREC).
