folks-

<p>
A friend has implemented wordlists using a linked-list to maintain the search 
order. He put two links in each wordlist structure, one for a static list of 
wordlists, the other a dynamic link for the search order. This avoided having 
to allocate an arbitrary amount of space for the search order list/stack.

<p>
After arguing with him that this is not compliant with the standard, I can't 
find anything explicit that backs me up. The problem with his method is that 
each wordlist can only appear ONCE in the search order. Well, that's not a 
problem in itself, but when a wordlist already in the search order is added 
to the top its previous location is lost! Again, that's not a real problem if 
the complete search order is always set explicitly, since the deeper 
occurrance 
will never produce a match.

<p>
But it sure messes up partial search order changes, such as using <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.0715>ALSO</a> or 
<a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.2037>PREVIOUS</a> to temporarily change the order. For example, the following sequence 
will hang his system:

<pre>
<a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.1965>ONLY</a> <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.1590>FORTH</a>
VOCABULARY HIDDEN
...
<a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.0715>ALSO</a> HIDDEN <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.0715>ALSO</a> <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.1590>FORTH</a>  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2535>\</a> so FORTH is searched first
...
<a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.2037>PREVIOUS</a>                <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2535>\</a> FORTH is no longer in the search order!!!
</pre>

The requirement that I can't find, but believe that we intended, based on 
extensive common practice, would require the phrase   set-order get-order  to 
have no effect on the stack (as long as set-order got valid arguments, 
anyway). 
The problem sure seemed obvious to me, but he doesn't think it is, and even 
came 
up with the following definitions to deal with the issue:

<p>
While these deal with some of the situations of adding and removing 
search-order 
entries, I've seen a lot of places (in Sun's OpenBoot, for example) where 
existing code would go up in flames if temporarily adding and removing a 
vocabulary that happened to already be in the search order took it out 
completely, as in my example above. Of course, the pathological (but currently 
working)  <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.1965>ONLY</a> <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.1590>FORTH</a> <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.0715>ALSO</a> <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.2037>PREVIOUS</a>  also leaves his search order empty.

<p>
Thanks for your responses (even the "you're a *&^#@*$%# idiot for wasting my 
time" ones add a data point!-)

In the following excerpt from the definition of <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.1.2197>SET-ORDER</a>, the phrase
"word lists" means "sequence of word lists".

<b><blockquote>
      Set the search order to the word lists identified by widn ... wid1.
      Subsequently, ...
</blockquote></b>

<a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.1.1647>GET-ORDER</a> must return exactly the same sequence of wids "widn .. wid1" that
appeared in the arguments to the most recent execution of <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.1.2197>SET-ORDER</a>, even
if a particular word list identifier appears more than once in that sequence.

<p>
A Standard System is permitted to optimize its searching process so that
the existence of repetetions in the search order need not result in redundant
searches, but if so (a) the behavior of <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.1.1647>GET-ORDER</a> and <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.1.2197>SET-ORDER</a> must be as
described in the preceding paragraph, and (b) the results of a search must
be indistinguishable in all cases from the results were there no such
optimizations.

Historically, in most implementations of the <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.0715>ALSO</a> .. <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.1965>ONLY</a> search order
mechanism, the sequence shown would result in the search order containing

<pre>
 &lt;minimum search order&gt; &lt;FORTH wordlist&gt; &lt;HIDDEN wordlist&gt;

The standard intends to codify that existing practice.

With these definitions, the sequence "ALSO GET-ORDER" would not yield the
result specified by the standard.

<i><blockquote>
While these deal with some of the situations of adding and removing 
search-order entries, I've seen a lot of places (in Sun's OpenBoot,
for example) where existing code would go up in flames if temporarily

leaves his search order empty.
</blockquote></i>

The ANS Forth search order wordset is intended to provide a predictable
mechanism for managing search orders in arbitrary ways, albeit subject to
the system-dependent limitation on the maximum number of word lists.  Some
applications, for example, choose to use the search order as a "stack",
adding and removing word lists without regard to whether or not those
word lists already appear in the search order.

Jax [Jack Woehr] voted No on LB13.  His comments follow:

LB13, Woehr: I made a proposal which was drowned out in Mitch's discus-
sion with himself on the maillist. It was letting Mitch make all the
decisions in consultation with himself that got us in trouble at the
spring meeting in Oregon in 1992 and delayed the standard by about a
year. I expect my proposals to be heard, even if not adopted, in hopes
we can avoid similar problems in the future.

---------  FOR THE RECORD  -----------------------------------
[Here is the e-mail message to which Woehr refers.  The active
part of the discussion occurred over a three day period, involved
about a dozen e-mail messages, and had seven participants who
posted.]

 I agree with Mitch whole-heartedly. I would move to add that:

"It is the sense of the X3J14 TC that no element of <a href=dpans17.htm#17.6.1.2191>SEARCH</a> <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.2.1985>ORDER</a> Wordset
introduces novelty into general Forth praxis, with the exception
that a <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.1.2460>WORDLIST</a> now has a tangible representation on the stack, whereas
FORTH-83 VOCABULARY had no such tangible representation. In all other
respects the de-facto behavior of Forth search order operations are
utterly unchanged from Forth-83."

 Do I hear a second?
