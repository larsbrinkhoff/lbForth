Wonyong Koh is literally correct, in the sense that optimizing
compilers which add special compilation semantics to classes of
definitions such as  CONSTANTs  are specifically supported by
ANS Forth.  Applying the concept, in these terms, to ANS Forth
has very clear meaning and leads to no inconsistencies.

<p> However, using the term "immediate" to speak of such compilation
semantics is not recommended since this term carries with it all of
the implications of the implementation model prescribed by earlier
standards such as FORTH-83.  Attempting to discuss the advanced
capabilities available to ANS Forth compilers in terms of "immediacy"
ineviteably leads to confusion, misunderstanding, and the eventual
"discovery" of apparent inconsistencies that do not, in fact, exist in
the Standard (although they may indeed exist in a particular
implementation.)  This in turn can lead to arguments over moot points.

<p>
In particular, a  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0950>CONSTANT</a>  with special compilation semantics
is *not* the same thing as is a  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0950>CONSTANT</a>  declared as follows:

<pre>
     123 <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0950>CONSTANT</a> JOE  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1710>IMMEDIATE</a>
</pre>

... but in ANS Forth terms, this usage is the *only* sense in
which the word "immediate" or the concept of "immediacy" is
defined or meaningful.  Always discuss ANS Forth compilation
semantics as such, not as "immediacy", for clarity and to avoid
pitfalls, even when discussing an implementation that uses
classical immediacy as its way for expressing compilation
semantics.

<h3>Analysis of Specific Case</h3>

However, upon review of the usenet discussion you reference, it would
appear that you may have added special compilation semantics to
CONSTANTs without adding all of the communication with the compiler
that is necessary to deliver the proper semantics in all cases when
such CONSTANTs are used.  The test case that failed seems likely to
have encountered one of these probable inconsistencies, as opposed to
"caring" whether the <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0950>CONSTANT</a> definition in question was "immediate"
in your implementation as such.

<p>
At the same time, the ability to declare an <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1710>IMMEDIATE</a> constant,
as in   123 <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0950>CONSTANT</a> JOE  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1710>IMMEDIATE</a>   had been precluded.

<p>
Careful review of the semantic requirements for definitions
when used in compilation, interpretation, and execution, as
well as the results of obtaining execution tokens and using
them with  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1370>EXECUTE</a>  or  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0945>COMPILE,</a> , and when referenced
following  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a>  (if  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0945>COMPILE,</a>  or  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a> are to
be supported) should make it clear that significant flow of
information is required between the compiler and the definition
when extending normally "default" compilation and/or
interpretation semantics of compliant definitions.

<p>
*The standard does not define the way in which this information
flow takes place.*  While a standard program may extend "macros"
such as control flow words as illustrated in the examples,
it is not possible to define words of the sort that normally
have "default" compilation and interpretation semantics such
that they have special compilation or interpretation semantics
without depending on implementation specific knowledge.  If
this is done without knowing how to communicate with the
compiler, the resulting definitions may deliver the correct
semantics in *some*, but cannot in *all*, cases.

<p>
For example, consider a Standard Program that adds special
compilation semantics to  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1290>DUP</a>  as in the following example:

<pre>
    <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2410>VARIABLE</a> #DUPS
    <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0450>:</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1290>DUP</a>   1 #DUPS <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0130>+!</a>  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2033>POSTPONE</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1290>DUP</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0460>;</a>  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1710>IMMEDIATE</a>
</pre>

If all this did was to count compilations of <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1290>DUP</a>, it would
be compliant since the additional work done affects nothing
else and is therefore OK (See section 3.)

<p>
However, this definition does not comply because it does not
yield the correct semantics in all cases.

<ul>
 <li> It compiles correctly
 <li> It interprets incorrectly
 <li> (what it compiles) executes correctly
 <li> Its tick, when EXECUTEd or COMPILE,'d executes incorrectly
 <li> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a> does not work correctly with it.
</ul>


And, coincidentally, execution of its tick is abysmally slow
(which would take more information flow to resolve, but which
is not required since it only affects performance as opposed
to correct execution.)

<p> If the word was made state smart to distinguish between interpret
and compile states, so that it counted #DUPS and did the <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2033>POSTPONE</a> when
in compilation state and simply executed <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1290>DUP</a> when interpreting, then
the situation changes but is still not correct:

<ul>
 <li> It compiles correctly
 <li> It interprets correctly
 <li> (what it compiles) executes correctly
 <li> Its tick, when EXECUTEd is correct if in interpret state
     at the time <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1370>EXECUTE</a> is invoked, but is incorrect if in compile
     state at the time
 <li> A definition into which its tick is  COMPILE,'d  runs
     correctly if the definition runs in interpret state but fails
     if it is run in compile state
 <li> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a> does not work correctly with it.
</ul>

And execution of the tick, even when correct, is still slow.

<p>
There is, at minimum, a bidirectional flow of information between
the compiler / interpreter and the definition of  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1290>DUP</a>  that must
occur around ticking and <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a> ; in its absence, the compiler
does not have any way of asking the definition for an *execution*
token, and the definition does not have any way to provide one;
and, in the case of <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a>, the compiler has no way of knowing
that this definition is supposed to be treated as though it had
default compilation semantics.

<p>
The TC did not attempt specifying this compiler interface because
it affects only new capabilities which were almost universally
impossible in earlier standards, and active experimentation is
still underway with these new capabilities, including as it
appears your own.  At some time in the future after more has
been learned it may be appropriate to standardize such a message
passing mechanism, however at present any *application* which
adds compilation semantics like this will need to incorporate
implementation dependent code... or it will yield noncompliant
definitions, as illustrated above.

<p> In the problem you have been discussing, you are the implementor
so you certainly have the power to create and then employ the
necessary interface.  However, it appears that you have overlooked
this necessity, and that is probably why you have been having
difficulty.

<h3>Discussion of Immediacy, Transparency, and Compliance</h3>

In FORTH-83 it was necessary to document the "I" (Immediate) attribute
of every standard word (and for that matter every word in each
application) because the application needed to be aware of this
attribute in order to make correct selections between use of COMPILE
and <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a> , and in order to predict the consequences of using what
are now called "execution tokens".  Since knowledge of immediate
versus nonimmediate attribute for each existing word appeared in
application programs in both explicit and implicit ways, it was not
practical to change the "immediacy" of any word in the system, nor
indeed in most applications.  The attribute of immediacy was the only
tool for making or discussing the distinc- tion between compilation
and execution behavior, and the need for program awareness of this
attribute as well as its inelastic nature led to a number of well
known inconsistencies.  In addition, it made compliance with FORTH-83
impractically cumbersome for many advanced compilers, including the
incremental optimizing sort.

<p>
ANS Forth addresses these problems by defining all words in terms
of explicit compilation, interpretation, and execution semantics;
by defining such words as  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1710>IMMEDIATE</a>  and  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a> and the effects
of <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1370>EXECUTE</a> with execution tokens as specific transformations and
selections on these semantics; by introducing  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2033>POSTPONE</a>  to solve
a well known dilemma in selection of the appropriate semantics;
and finally by deleting the "I" designations since it is no longer
necessary for the application programmer to be aware of them as
such.  Finally, having done these things, it is possible for a
compiler to add any desired compilation semantics, including those
useful for optimization purposes, to definitions without affecting
the use of those definitions by applications.  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1710>IMMEDIATE</a> remains
available for application use, but its effects are specified in
semantic terms that can coexist with arbitrary default compilation
semantics.

<p>
In ANS Forth, the existence and nature of compilation semantics
that are in effect messages to the compiler is concealed well
from the programmer, and the application code is the same whether
or not, for example,  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1290>DUP</a>  is "immediate" (in the old terms) or
"has special compilation semantics" (in ANS Forth terms).  The
only significant caveat is that when a system supports  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a>
it must be very careful to treat all definitions that the
Standard says have "default" compilation semantics, but to
which the system has given "special" compilation semantics
for its own purposes, as though they had "default" compilation
semantics when referenced by  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a>.

<p>
An implementation complies with the standard if all Forth words
and classes of words defined by the Standard behave, in all cases,
consistently with the semantics prescribed in the Standard.  The
test for correctness is specifically limited to semantics, as
opposed to nonsemantic considerations such as, for example,
the size, speed, or binary representation of compiled programs.

of optimizing compilers and ANS Forth handling of "immediacy".
