<H1>E. ANS Forth portability guide (informative
annex)</H1>


<hr>
<A name=E.1>
<H1>E.1 Introduction</H1>
</a>

The most popular architectures used to implement Forth have had
byte-addressed memory, 16-bit operations, and two's-complement number
representation. The Forth-83 Standard dictates that these particular
features must be present in a Forth-83 Standard system and that Forth-83
programs may exploit these features freely.

<P>

However, there are many beasts in the architectural jungle that are bit
addressed or cell addressed, or prefer 32-bit operations, or represent
numbers in one's complement. Since one of Forth's strengths is its
usefulness in <B>strange</B> environments on <B>unusual</B> hardware
with <B>peculiar</B> features, it is important that a Standard Forth run
on these machines too.

<P>

A primary goal of the ANS Forth Standard is to increase the types of
machines that can support a Standard Forth. This is accomplished by
allowing some key Forth terms to be implementation-defined (e.g., how
big is a cell?) and by providing Forth operators (words) that conceal
the implementation. This frees the implementor to produce the Forth
system that most effectively utilizes the native hardware. The machine
independent operators, together with some programmer discipline, enable
a programmer to write Forth programs that work on a wide variety of
machines.

<P>

The remainder of this Annex provides guidelines for writing portable ANS
Forth programs. The first section describes ways to make a program
hardware independent. It is difficult for someone familiar with only
one machine architecture to imagine the problems caused by transporting
programs between dissimilar machines. Consequently, examples of
specific architectures with their respective problems are given. The
second section describes assumptions about Forth implementations that
many programmers make, but can't be relied upon in a portable program.

<P>

<H1>E.2 Hardware peculiarities</H1>
</a>


<hr>
<A name=E.2.1>
<H2>E.2.1 Data/memory abstraction</H2>
</a>

Data and memory are the stones and mortar of program construction.
Unfortunately, each computer treats data and memory differently. The
ANS Forth Systems Standard gives definitions of data and memory that
apply to a wide variety of computers. These definitions give us a way
to talk about the common elements of data and memory while ignoring the
details of specific hardware. Similarly, ANS Forth programs that use
data and memory in ways that conform to these definitions can also
ignore hardware details. The following sections discuss the definitions
and describe how to write programs that are independent of the
data/memory peculiarities of different computers.
<P>



<hr>
<A name=E.2.2>
<H2>E.2.2 Definitions</H2>
</a>

Three terms defined by ANS Forth are address unit, cell, and character.
The address space of an ANS Forth system is divided into an array of
address units; an address unit is the smallest collection of bits that
can be addressed. In other words, an address unit is the number of bits
spanned by the addresses addr and addr+1. The most prevalent machines
use 8-bit address units. Such <B>byte addressed</B> machines include
the Intel 8086 and Motorola 68000 families. However, other address unit
sizes exist. There are machines that are bit addressed and machines
that are 4-bit nibble addressed. There are also machines with address
units larger than 8-bits. For example, several Forth-in-hardware
computers are cell addressed.

<P>

The cell is the fundamental data type of a Forth system. A cell can be
a single-cell integer or a memory address. Forth's parameter and return
stacks are stacks of cells. Forth-83 specifies that a cell is 16-bits.
In ANS Forth the size of a cell is an implementation-defined number of
address units. Thus, an ANS Forth implemented on a 16-bit
microprocessor could use a 16-bit cell and an implementation on a 32-bit
machine could use a 32-bit cell. Also 18-bit machines, 36-bit machines,
etc., could support ANS Forth systems with 18 or 36-bit cells
respectively. In all of these systems, 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1290>DUP</a> 
does the same thing: it
duplicates the top of the data stack. 
! (<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0010>store</a>) 
behaves consistently
too: given two cells on the data stack it stores the second cell in the
memory location designated by the top cell.

<P>

Similarly, the definition of a character has been generalized to be an
implementation-defined number of address units (but at least eight
bits). This removes the need for a Forth implementor to provide 8-bit
characters on processors where it is inappropriate. For example, on an
18-bit machine with a 9-bit address unit, a 9-bit character would be
most convenient. Since, by definition, you can't address anything
smaller than an address unit, a character must be at least as big as an
address unit. This will result in big characters on machines with large
address units. An example is a 16-bit cell addressed machine where a
16-bit character makes the most sense.

<P>


<hr>
<A name=E.2.3>
<H2>E.2.3 Addressing memory</H2>
</a>

ANS Forth eliminates many portability problems by using the above
definitions. One of the most common portability problems is addressing
successive cells in memory. Given the memory address of a cell, how do
you find the address of the next cell? In Forth-83 this is easy: 2 + .
This code assumes that memory is addressed in 8-bit units (bytes) and a
cell is 16-bits wide. On a byte-addressed machine with 32-bit cells the
code to find the next cell would be 4 + . The code would be 1+ on a
cell-addressed processor and 16+ on a bit-addressed processor with
16-bit cells. ANS Forth provides a next-cell operator named 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0880>CELL+</a> 
that
can be used in all of these cases. Given an address, CELL+ adjusts the
address by the size of a cell (measured in address units). A related
problem is that of addressing an array of cells in an arbitrary order.
A defining word to create an array of cells using Forth-83 would be:


<PRE>
	: ARRAY   CREATE  2* ALLOT  DOES> SWAP 2* + ;
</PRE>

<P>

Use of 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0320>2*</a> 
to scale the array index assumes byte addressing and 16-bit
cells again. As in the example above, different versions of the code
would be needed for different machines. ANS Forth provides a portable
scaling operator named 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0890>CELLS</a>. 
Given a number n, CELLS returns the
number of address units needed to hold n cells. A portable definition
of array is:

<PRE>
	: ARRAY   CREATE  CELLS ALLOT
	   DOES> SWAP CELLS + ;
</PRE>
<P>

There are also portability problems with addressing arrays of
characters. In Forth-83 (and in the most common ANS Forth
implementations), the size of a character will equal the size of an
address unit. Consequently addresses of successive characters in memory
can be found using 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0290>1+</a> 
and scaling indices into a character array is a
no-op (i.e., 1 *). However, there are cases where a character is larger
than an address unit. Examples include (1) systems with small address
units (e.g., bit- and nibble-addressed systems), and (2) systems with
large character sets (e.g., 16-bit characters on a byte-addressed
machine). 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0897>CHAR+</a> 
and 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0898>CHARS</a> 
operators, analogous to CELL+ and CELLS are
available to allow maximum portability.
<P>

ANS Forth generalizes the definition of some Forth words that operate on
chunks of memory to use address units. One example is 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0710>ALLOT</a>. By
prefixing ALLOT with the appropriate scaling operator (CELLS, CHARS,
etc.), space for any desired data structure can be allocated (see
definition of array above). For example:

<PRE>
	CREATE ABUFFER 5 CHARS ALLOT ( allot 5 character buffer)
</PRE>
<P>

The memory-block-move
word also uses address units:


<PRE>
	source destination 8 CELLS MOVE  (  move 8 cells)
</PRE>
<P>


<hr>
<A name=E.2.4>
<H2>E.2.4 Alignment problems</H2>
</a>

Not all addresses are created equal. Many processors have restrictions
on the addresses that can be used by memory access instructions. This
Standard does not require an implementor of an ANS Forth to make
alignment transparent; on the contrary, it requires (in 
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.3.3.1>Section 3.3.3.1</a>
Address alignment) that an ANS Forth program assume that character and
cell alignment may be required.

<P>

One of the most common problems caused by alignment restrictions is in
creating tables containing both characters and cells. When 
, (<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0150>comma</a>) or
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0860>C,</a> 
is used to initialize a table, data is stored at the data-space
pointer. Consequently, it must be suitably aligned. For example, a
non-portable table definition would be:


<PRE>
	CREATE ATABLE   1 C,  X ,  2 C,  Y ,
</PRE>

<P>

On a machine that restricts 16-bit fetches to even addresses, 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a>
would leave the data space pointer at an even address, the 1 C, would
make the data space pointer odd, and , (comma) would violate the address
restriction by storing X at an odd address. A portable way to create
the table is:


<PRE>
	CREATE ATABLE   1 C,  ALIGN X ,  2 C,  ALIGN Y ,
</PRE>

<P>

<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0705>ALIGN</a> 
adjusts the data space pointer to the first aligned address
greater than or equal to its current address. An aligned address is
suitable for storing or fetching characters, cells, cell pairs, or
double-cell numbers.

<P>

After initializing the table, we would also like to read values from the
table. For example, assume we want to fetch the first cell, X, from the
table. ATABLE CHAR+ gives the address of the first thing after the
character. However this may not be the address of X since we aligned
the dictionary pointer between the C, and the ,. The portable way to
get the address of X is:


<PRE>
	ATABLE CHAR+ ALIGNED
</PRE>

<P>

<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0706>ALIGNED</a> 
adjusts the address on top of the stack to the first aligned
address greater than or equal to its current value.

<P>


<hr>
<A name=E.3>
<H1>E.3 Number representation</H1>
</a>

Different computers represent numbers in different ways. An awareness
of these differences can help a programmer avoid writing a program that
depends on a particular representation.

<P>


<hr>
<A name=E.3.1>
<H2>E.3.1 Big endian vs. little endian</H2>
</a>

The constituent bits of a number in memory are kept in different orders
on different machines. Some machines place the most-significant part of
a number at an address in memory with less-significant parts following
it at higher addresses. Other machines do the opposite the
least-significant part is stored at the lowest address. For example,
the following code for a 16-bit 8086 <B>little endian</B> Forth would
produce the answer 34 (hex):


<PRE>
	VARIABLE FOO   HEX 1234 FOO !   FOO C@
</PRE>
<P>

The same code on a 16-bit 68000 <B>big endian</B> Forth would produce
the answer 12 (hex). A portable program cannot exploit the
representation of a number in memory.

<P>

A related issue is the representation of cell pairs and double-cell
numbers in memory. When a cell pair is moved from the stack to memory
with 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0310>2!</a>, 
the cell that was on top of the stack is placed at the lower
memory address. It is useful and reasonable to manipulate the
individual cells when they are in memory.

<P>


<hr>
<A name=E.3.2>
<H2>E.3.2 ALU organization</H2>
</a>

Different computers use different bit patterns to represent integers.
Possibilities include binary representations (two's complement, one's
complement, sign magnitude, etc.) and decimal representations (BCD,
etc.). Each of these formats creates advantages and disadvantages in
the design of a computer's arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The most
commonly used representation, two's complement, is popular because of
the simplicity of its addition and subtraction algorithms.

<P>

Programmers who have grown up on two's complement machines tend to
become intimate with their representation of numbers and take some
properties of that representation for granted. For example, a trick to
find the remainder of a number divided by a power of two is to mask off
some bits with 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0720>AND</a>. 
A common application of this trick is to test a
number for oddness using 1 AND. However, this will not work on a one's
complement machine if the number is negative (a portable technique is 2
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1890>MOD</a>).

<P>

The remainder of this section is a (non-exhaustive) list of things to
watch for when portability between machines with binary representations
other than two's complement is desired.

<P>

To convert a single-cell number to a double-cell number, ANS Forth
provides the operator 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2170>S>D</a>. 
To convert a double-cell number to
single-cell, Forth programmers have traditionally used 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1260>DROP</a>. 
However,
this trick doesn't work on sign-magnitude machines. For portability a
<a href=dpans8.htm#8.6.1.1140>D&gt;S</a> 
operator is available. Converting an unsigned single-cell number to
a double-cell number can be done portably by pushing a zero on the
stack.

<P>


<hr>
<A name=E.4>
<H1>E.4 Forth system implementation</H1>
</a>

During Forth's history, an amazing variety of implementation techniques
have been developed. The ANS Forth Standard encourages this diversity
and consequently restricts the assumptions a user can make about the
underlying implementation of an ANS Forth system. Users of a particular
Forth implementation frequently become accustomed to aspects of the
implementation and assume they are common to all Forths. This section
points out many of these incorrect assumptions.

<P>


<hr>
<A name=E.4.1>
<H2>E.4.1 Definitions</H2>
</a>

Traditionally, Forth definitions have consisted of the name of the Forth
word, a dictionary search link, data describing how to execute the
definition, and parameters describing the definition itself. These
components are called the name, link, code, and parameter fields. No
method for accessing these fields has been found that works across all
of the Forth implementations currently in use. Therefore, ANS Forth
severely restricts how the fields may be used. Specifically, a portable
ANS Forth program may not use the name, link, or code field in any way.
Use of the parameter field (renamed to data field for clarity) is
limited to the operations described below.

<P>

Only words defined with 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a> 
or with other defining words that call
CREATE have data fields. The other defining words in the Standard
(<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2410>VARIABLE</a>, 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0950>CONSTANT</a>, 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0450>:</a>, 
etc.) might not be implemented with CREATE.
Consequently, a Standard Program must assume that words defined by
VARIABLE, CONSTANT, : , etc., may have no data fields. There is no way
for a Standard Program to modify the value of a constant or to change
the meaning of a colon definition. The 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES</a>> 
part of a defining word
operates on a data field. Since only CREATEd words have data fields,
DOES> can only be paired with CREATE or words that call CREATE.

<P>

In ANS Forth, 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1550>FIND</a>, 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2510>[']</a> and 
' (<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0070>tick</a>) 
return an unspecified entity called
an <B>execution token</B>. There are only a few things that may be done
with an execution token. The token may be passed to 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1370>EXECUTE</a> 
to execute
the word ticked or compiled into the current definition with 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0945>COMPILE,</a>.
The token can also be stored in a variable and used later. Finally, if
the word ticked was defined via CREATE, 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0550>>BODY</a> 
converts the execution
token into the word's data-field address.

<P>

One thing that definitely cannot be done with an execution token is use
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0010>!</a> 
or 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0150>,</a> 
to store it into the object code of a Forth definition. This
technique is sometimes used in implementations where the object code is
a list of addresses (threaded code) and an execution token is also an
address. However, ANS Forth permits native code implementations where
this will not work.

<P>


<hr>
<A name=E.4.2>
<H2>E.4.2 Stacks</H2>
</a>

In some Forth implementations, it is possible to find the address of a
stack in memory and manipulate the stack as an array of cells. This
technique is not portable, however. On some systems, especially
Forth-in-hardware systems, the stacks might be in a part of memory that
can't be addressed by the program or might not be in memory at all.
Forth's parameter and return stacks must be treated as stacks.

<P>

A Standard Program may use the return stack directly only for
temporarily storing values. Every value examined or removed from the
return stack using 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2070>R@</a>, 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2060>R></a>, or 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0410>2R></a> 
must have been put on the stack
explicitly using 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0580>>R</a> or 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0340>2>R</a>. 
Even this must be done carefully since the
system may use the return stack to hold return addresses and
loop-control parameters. 
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.2.3.3>Section 3.2.3.3</a> Return stack of the Standard
has a list of restrictions.

<P>


<hr>
<A name=E.5>
<H1>E.5 ROMed application disciplines and conventions</H1>
</a>

When a Standard System provides a data space which is uniformly readable
and writeable we may term this environment <B>RAM-only</B>.

<P>

Programs designed for ROMed application must divide data space into at
least two parts: a writeable and readable uninitialized part, called
<B>RAM</B>, and a read-only initialized part, called <B>ROM</B>. A
third possibility, a writeable and readable initialized part, normally
called <B>initialized RAM</B>, is not addressed by this discipline. A
Standard Program must explicitly initialize the RAM data space as
needed.

<P>

The separation of data space into RAM and ROM is meaningful only during
the generation of the ROMed program. If the ROMed program is itself a
standard development system, it has the same taxonomy as an ordinary
RAM-only system.

<P>

The words affected by conversion from a RAM-only to a mixed RAM and ROM
environment are:

<p>
, (<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0150>comma</a>)  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0705>ALIGN</a>  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0706>ALIGNED</a>  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0710>ALLOT</a>  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0860>C,</a>  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a>  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1650>HERE</a>  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2395>UNUSED</a>
<P>

(<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2410>VARIABLE</a> always
accesses the RAM data space.)

<P>

With the exception of , (comma) and C,
these words are meaningful in both RAM
and ROM data space.

<P>

To select the data space, these words could be preceded by selectors RAM
and ROM. For example:


<PRE>
	ROM  CREATE ONES  32 ALLOT  ONES 32 1 FILL  RAM
</PRE>

<P>

would create a table of ones in the ROM data space. The storage of data
into RAM data space when generating a program for ROM would be an
ambiguous condition.

<P>

A straightforward implementation of these selectors would maintain
separate address counters for each space. A counter value would be
returned by HERE and altered by , (comma), C,, ALIGN, and ALLOT, with
RAM and ROM simply selecting the appropriate address counter. This
technique could be extended to additional partitions of the data space.

<P>


<hr>
<A name=E.6>
<H1>E.6 Summary</H1>
</a>

The ANS Forth Standard cannot and should not force anyone to write a
portable program. In situations where performance is paramount, the
programmer is encouraged to use every trick in the book. On the other
hand, if portability to a wide variety of systems is needed, ANS Forth
provides the tools to accomplish this. There is probably no such thing
as a completely portable program. A programmer, using this guide,
should intelligently weigh the tradeoffs of providing portability to
specific machines. For example, machines that use sign-magnitude
numbers are rare and probably don't deserve much thought. But, systems
with different cell sizes will certainly be encountered and should be
provided for. In general, making a program portable clarifies both the
programmer's thinking process and the final program.
