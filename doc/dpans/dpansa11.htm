<H3>A.11 The optional File-Access word set</H3>

Many Forth systems support access to a host file system, and many of
these support interpretation of Forth from source text files.  The
Forth-83 Standard did not address host OS files.  Nevertheless, a degree
of similarity exists among modern implementations.

<P>

For example, files must be opened and closed, created and deleted.
Forth file-system implementations differ mostly in the treatment and
disposition of the exception codes, and in the format of the
file-identification strings.  The underlying mechanism for creating
file-control blocks might or might not be visible.  We have chosen to
keep it invisible.

<P>

Files must also be read and written.  Text files, if supported, must be
read and written one line at a time.  Interpretation of text files
implies that they are somehow integrated into the text interpreter input
mechanism.  These and other requirements have shaped the file-access
extensions word set.

<P>

Most of the existing implementations studied use simple English words
for common host file functions: OPEN, CLOSE, READ, etc.  Although we
would have preferred to do likewise, there were so many minor variations
in implementation of these words that adopting any particular meaning
would have broken much existing code.  We have used names with a suffix
-FILE for most of these words.  We encourage implementors to conform
their single-word primitives to the ANS behaviors, and hope that if this
is done on a widespread basis we can adopt better definition names in a
future standard.

<P>

Specific rationales
for members of this word set follow.

<H4>A.11.3.2 Blocks in files</H4>
</a>

Many systems reuse file identifiers; when a file is closed, a
subsequently opened file may be given the same identifier.  If the
original file has blocks still in block buffers, these will be
incorrectly associated with the newly opened file with disastrous
results.  The block buffer system must be flushed to avoid this.

<P>

Some operating systems require that files be opened in a different mode
to access their contents as an unstructured stream of binary data rather
than as a sequence of lines.

The arguments to 
<a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.2080>READ-FILE</a> and 
<a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.2480>WRITE-FILE</a> are 
arrays of character
storage elements, each element consisting of at least 8 bits.  The
Technical Committee intends that, in BIN mode, the contents of these
storage elements can be written to a file and later read back without
alteration.  The Technical Committee has declined to address issues
regarding the impact of <B>wide</B> characters on the File and Block
word sets.

Here are two implementation alternatives for saving the input source
specification in the presence of text file input:

<P>

1)      Save the file position (as returned by 
<a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.1520>FILE-POSITION</a>) of the beginning
of the line being interpreted.  To restore the input source specification,
seek to that position and re-read the line into the input buffer.

<P>

2)      Allocate a separate line buffer for each active text input file, using
that buffer as the input buffer.  This method avoids the <B>seek and reread</B>
step, and allows the use of <B>pseudo-files</B> such as pipes and other
sequential-access-only communication channels.

A typical sequential
file-processing algorithm might look like:

<PRE>
   BEGIN                (  )
   ... READ-FILE THROW  ( length )
   ?DUP WHILE           ( length )
   ...                  (  )
   REPEAT               (  )
</PRE>

<P>

In this example, 
<a href=dpans9.htm#9.6.1.2275>THROW</a> 
is used to handle (unexpected) exception
conditions, which are reported as non-zero values of the ior return
value from READ-FILE.  End-of-file is reported as a zero value of the
<B>length</B> return value.

<P>

<hr>
<a name=A.11.6.1.2090>
A.11.6.1.2090 READ-LINE
</a>
<P>

Implementations are allowed to store the line terminator in the memory
buffer in order to allow the use of line reading functions provided by
host operating systems, some of which store the terminator.  Without
this provision, a temporary buffer might be needed.  The two-character
limitation is sufficient for the vast majority of existing operating
systems.  Implementations on host operating systems whose line
terminator sequence is longer than two characters may have to take
special action to prevent the storage of more than two terminator
characters.

<P>

Standard Programs may not depend on the presence of any such terminator
sequence in the buffer.

<P>

A typical line-oriented sequential file-processing algorithm might look
like:

<PRE>
   BEGIN                (  )
   ... READ-LINE THROW  ( length not-eof-flag )
   WHILE                ( length )
   ...                  (  )
   REPEAT DROP          (  )
</PRE>

<P>

In this example, 
<a href=dpans9.htm#9.6.1.2275>THROW</a> 
is used to handle (unexpected) I/O exception condition,
which are reported as non-zero values of the <B>ior</B> return value from
READ-LINE.

<P>

READ-LINE needs a separate end-of-file flag because empty (zero-length) lines
are a routine occurrence, so a zero-length line cannot be used to signify
end-of-file.

<P>

<hr>
<a name=A.11.6.1.2165>
A.11.6.1.2165 S"

<P>

Typical use:    <code>... S" ccc" ...</code>

<P>

The interpretation semantics for S" are intended to provide a simple
mechanism for entering a string in the interpretation state.  Since an
implementation may choose to provide only one buffer for interpreted
strings, an interpreted string is subject to being overwritten by the
next execution of S" in interpretation state.  It is intended that no
standard words other than S" should in themselves cause the interpreted
string to be overwritten.  However, since words such as 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a>, 
<a href=dpans7.htm#7.6.1.1790>LOAD</a>,
<a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.1717>INCLUDE-FILE</a> and 
<a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.1718>INCLUDED</a> 
can result in the interpretation of arbitrary
text, possibly including instances of S", the interpreted string may be
invalidated by some uses of these words.

<P>

When the possibility of overwriting a string can arise, it is prudent to
copy the string to a <B>safe</B> buffer allocated by the application.

<P>

Programs wishing to parse in the fashion of S" are advised to use 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2008>PARSE</a>
or 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2450>WORD</a> 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0980>COUNT</a> 
instead of S", preventing the overwriting of the
interpreted string buffer.
