Request from TC member Jonah Thomas (Jet.Thomas@minerva.com)

<p>
Here's a question about the Standard:

<p>
When is it allowed to write into input buffers?

<p>
On the surface this is simple:  "A program shall not write into the
input buffer."

<p>
But what about this:

<pre>
{
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0450>:</a> CHANGE-TEXT <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2165>S"</a>  <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.2465>WORDS</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> " <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2165>S"</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2160>ROT</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2260>SWAP</a> MOVE" <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0460>;</a>

 <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2216>SOURCE</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1260>DROP</a> CHANGE-TEXT <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a>
}
</pre>

Our input buffer starts out with

<pre>
 <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2216>SOURCE</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1260>DROP</a> CHANGE-TEXT <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a>
</pre>

When it executes CHANGE-TEXT it has ( ca ) the buffer address on the
stack.  CHANGE-TEXT first provides a string ( ca ca' u ) then another
string ( ca ca' u ca" u") and then evaluates the second string.  The
original buffer is now not the input buffer, now the 2nd string is
the read-only input buffer.  It does <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2160>ROT</a> ( ca' u ca ) 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2260>SWAP</a> ( ca' ca u)
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1900>MOVE</a> and moves the first string into 
the original input buffer, which now
reads

<pre>
 <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.2465>WORDS</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2216>SOURCE</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1260>DROP</a> CHANGE-TEXT <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a>
</pre>

Then it reverts to the changed input buffer and does the final 
<a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.1.0220>.S</a> .

<p>
I say that even if this is legal, it's bad practice.  If you want to 
alter an input buffer, better to copy it into your own private area and
change it however you like and then do <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> .

<p>
My question is whether this _is_ legal, and why or why not.

<p>
I originally interpreted a previous dpANS document as saying that the
user input buffer, the one pointed to by the obsolescent 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2290>TIB</a> and <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0060>#TIB</a> ,
is read-only.  That makes a different kind of sense to me.  In some
systems it could be a read-only pipe from some other process, or it could
be some special hardware read-only buffer.  It makes sense to me that the
user input buffer should never be modified by a standard program.

<p>
So I can see 4 obvious choices, with perhaps others also available:

<ol>

<li>The current input buffer is read-only; strings which are not the
current input buffer may be written to unless they're read-only for some
other reason.

<li>The current input buffer is read-only as is the user input buffer;
any region of allotted memory is read/write except while it is the input
buffer.

<li>Any region of memory that is EVALUATEd is forever after read-only.

<li>Any region of memory that is EVALUATEd is read-only until the
evaluation is complete -- either by evaluation until the parse area is
empty and return from <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> or 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1380>EXIT</a> found in the evaluated string, or
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2050>QUIT</a> or 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0670>ABORT</a> performed before evaluation is 
finished, or if an ambiguous
condition exists due to the code evaluated.

</ol>

I don't like #3, since I sometimes want to evaluate text that's in block
buffers or file buffers.  #4 could take a lot of figuring to tell whether
it's being violated or not.  I like #1, but it seems to allow some
atrocious practices in standard code.  #2 has the further problem that
there is no way for a program to tell whether an address is in the 
read-only user input buffer, except with 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2218>SOURCE-ID</a> or 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2290>TIB</a> , both of which 
are in an optional extension wordset.

<p>
Any ideas?

<h3>Q0006:  When is it allowed to write into input buffers?</h3>

Request from TC member Jonah Thomas (Jet.Thomas@minerva.com)

<i><blockquote>
Here's a question about the Standard:

When is it allowed to write into input buffers?
</blockquote></i>

When a standard program receives the address and length of the
'input buffer' from the word  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2216>SOURCE</a>  
it *must* treat this information as though it describes a read-only region of memory.

<p>
This is one of the conditions that must be met in order to compose
code whose processing of 'input buffers' is independent of the
physical and logical characteristics of the diverse 'input sources'
described in the Standard.

<p>
It is logically possible for an application to alter the 'input
buffer' supplied to  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a>  
while that 'input buffer' is being
processed.  This possibility exists as a special case because the
application actually "owns" and has full control over the buffer
in question.  As owner of the buffer, and both producer and 
consumer of the data it contains, the application can alter this
buffer and manipulate  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0560>>IN</a>  with 
deterministic results, assuming
that it knows the buffer to exist in physically writable memory.

<p>
The Standard does not describe this possibility because the
implied coding methods constitute a special case which is only
usable with  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a>  and can 
lead to the development of source
language syntax which is not processable from other 'input sources.'

<h3>Relevant text from the Standard:</h3>

<dl>

        of characters from the input source that is currently
        accessible to a program.
 </dl>

<dt>
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.3.3.5>3.3.3.5</a>  Input buffers
<dd>
    The address, length, and content of the 'input buffer' may be
        transient.  A program shall not write into the 'input
        buffer'.  ... the 'input buffer' is either ... or a buffer
        specified by  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> .  ...  An ambiguous condition
        exists if a program modifies the contents of the 'input
        buffer'."

</dl>

<h3>Discussion of Technical Committee Intent</h3>

<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2040>QUERY</a> and <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2290>TIB</a> 
have been deprecated because while some systems have
a discrete *place* called <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2290>TIB</a> that is 
exclusively used for storing
the results of <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2040>QUERY</a>, other existing systems 
actually use <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.2290>TIB</a> as a
handle for the current line being interpreted from a file.  While
applications exist making either assumption, these applications can
obviously not work properly on both sorts of systems in general.

<p>Storing into 'input buffers' is disallowed because we permit input
sources to nest indefinitely and it is not practical for systems
that conserve resources to guarantee unique concurrent addressability
of all nested input sources, nor is it practical to create separate
save areas for all current input buffers just in case someone stored
into one of them.  The TC specifically intends that, when input is
coming from refreshable sources, implementations may refresh their
buffers on un-nesting to conserve resources, and that when logically
possible implementations may use transient, shared buffers (as is
common practice with  <a href=dpans7.htm#7.6.1.1790>LOAD</a>  on 
multiprogrammed systems.)  Therefore,
the results of storing into input buffers is stated as ambiguous,
and may even be physically disallowed, as in the case of interpreting
source from read only memory mapped files in some operating systems.

<p>
For similar reasons the address returned by  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2216>SOURCE</a>  is transient,
and there is specifically no guarantee that any 'input buffer' other
than *the* (current) 'input buffer' is addressable at any time, nor
that this address be valid after nesting or un-nesting.  (Indeed,
in classical multiprogrammed systems the address returned by
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2216>SOURCE</a> is no longer valid after using 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2450>WORD</a> .)

<p>
The TC expects all Systems to process buffers provided by  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a>
in place.  This is logically necessary, in our view, since there are
no upper limits on the lengths of these buffers.  Since it is 
semantically permissible to describe more than half of addressable memory
in an <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a>  string it is not in 
general *possible* to copy such a
string elsewhere and address it consistently with the definition
of  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2216>SOURCE</a> .

<p>
Systems are not allowed to alter the contents of 'input buffers' 
provided through  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> .  At the 
same time, applications are responsible for guaranteeing that the 
buffers they provide to  <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a>  are
static in both address and content until the  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a>  has completed.

<p>
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> is a special case since the 
input buffer is literally
the area of memory provided to <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> and 
is as such static.
The application "owns" the memory it occupies, and the mechanism
for messaging the interpreter via <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0560>>IN</a> 
(as well as the syntax of
Forth) implies no prefetching or preprocessing of input buffers
is necessary or appropriate.

<p>
Given these conditions, it *is* deterministic for an application to
store (with great care) into <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> buffers 
that it knows to be
active, although such methods pertain exclusively to 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> and
certainly not to any other input stream source.

<p>
However, as the Standard is written, any program that does this is
not a standard program.

<hr>

It has been brought to the TC's attention that there exists at least
one implementation which moves an <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> 
string to a separate work
area for processing.  As a separate but related question we have
been asked whether a system which does this, and which therefore
fails John Hayes' test suite, is compliant.  (The test in question
fails if the buffer address and length returned by 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2216>SOURCE</a> occurring
in an <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> string differ from the 
address and length of the
argument provided to EVALUATE.)

<p>
The system in question is definitely not compliant since both the
letter of the standard and the intent of the TC are that 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a>
strings be processed in place.  The fact that John's test suite is
able to detect the deviation confirms its visibility to application
code, assuming that any such code ever makes such a comparison.

<p>
The ambiguity documented for storing into 'input buffers' serves to
mitigate the seriousness of this noncompliance since any program
which stores into an active <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> 
string is environmentally dependent on the system's resolution of 
the ambiguity.  Nevertheless, the
Standard clearly states that the <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> 
string *is* the 'input
buffer' (by definition a region of memory), and that 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2216>SOURCE</a> returns
the address and length of this region of memory.  This is an unqualified 
promise to people writing standard programs, and any system
which breaks that promise must document its nonstandard implementations 
of <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>EVALUATE</a> and <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2216>SOURCE</a>.
