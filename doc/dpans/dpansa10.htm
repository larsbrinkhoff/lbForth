Most implementors supply a method of positioning a cursor on a CRT
screen, but there is great variance in names and stack arguments.  This
version is supported by at least one major vendor.

KEY?
</a>
<P>

The Technical Committee has gone around several times on the stack
effects.  Whatever is decided will violate somebody's practice and
penalize some machine.  This way doesn't interfere with type-ahead on
some systems, while requiring the implementation of a single-character
buffer on machines where polling the keyboard inevitably results in the
destruction of the character.

<P>

Use of 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1750>KEY</a> 
or KEY? indicates that the application does not wish to
bother with non-character events, so they are discarded, in anticipation
of eventually receiving a valid character.  Applications wishing to
handle non-character events must use 
<a href=dpans10.htm#10.6.2.1305>EKEY</a> and 
<a href=dpans10.htm#10.6.2.1307>EKEY?</a>.  It is possible to
mix uses of KEY? / KEY and EKEY? / EKEY within a single application, but
the application must use KEY? and KEY only when it wishes to discard
non-character events until a valid character is received.

<P>

EKEY
</a>
<P>

EKEY provides a standard word to access a system-dependent set of
<B>raw</B> keyboard events, including events corresponding to members of
the standard character set, events corresponding to other members of the
implementation-defined character set, and keystrokes that do not
correspond to members of the character set.

<P>

EKEY assumes no particular numerical correspondence between particular
event code values and the values representing standard characters.  On
some systems, this may allow two separate keys that correspond to the
same standard character to be distinguished from one another.

<P>

In systems that combine both keyboard and mouse events into a single
<B>event stream</B>, the single number returned by EKEY may be
inadequate to represent the full range of input possibilities.  In such
systems, a single <B>event record</B> may include a time stamp, the x,y
coordinates of the mouse position, the keyboard state, and the state of
the mouse buttons.  In such systems, it might be appropriate for EKEY to
return the address of an <B>event record</B> from which the other
information could be extracted.

<P>

Also, consider a hypothetical Forth system running under MS-DOS on a
PC-compatible computer.  Assume that the implementation-defined
character set is the <B>normal</B> 8-bit PC character set.  In that
character set, the codes from 0 to 127 correspond to ASCII characters.
The codes from 128 to 255 represent characters from various non-English
languages, mathematical symbols, and some graphical symbols used for
line drawing.  In addition to those characters, the keyboard can
generate various other <B>scan codes</B>, representing such
non-character events as arrow keys and function keys.

<P>

There may be multiple keys, with different scan codes, corresponding to
the same standard character.  For example, the character representing
the number <B>1</B> often appears both in the row of number keys above
the alphabetic keys, and also in the separate numeric keypad.

<P>

When a program asks the MS-DOS operating system for a keyboard event, it
receives either a single non-zero byte, representing a character, or a
zero byte followed by a <B>scan code</B> byte, representing a
non-character keyboard event (e.g., a function key).

<P>

EKEY represents each keyboard event as a single number, rather than as a
sequence of numbers.  For the system described above, the following
would be a reasonable implementation of EKEY and related words:

<P>

The 
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.2.6>MAX-CHAR</a>
environmental query would return 255.

<P>

Assume the existence of a word DOS-KEY ( -- char ) which executes the
MS-DOS <B>Direct STDIN Input</B> system call (Interrupt 21h, Function
07h) and a word DOS-KEY? ( -- flag) which executes the MS-DOS <B>Check
STDIN Status</B> system call (Interrupt 21h, Function 0Bh).

<PRE>
: EKEY?  ( -- flag )  DOS-KEY?  0&lt;&gt;  ;

: EKEY  ( -- u )  DOS-KEY  ?DUP 0= IF  DOS-KEY 256 +  THEN ;

: EKEY>CHAR  ( u -- u false | char true )
    DUP 255 &gt; IF          ( u )
    DUP 259 = IF           \ 259 is Ctrl-@ (ASCII NUL)
        DROP 0 TRUE EXIT   \ so replace with character
      THEN FALSE EXIT      \ otherwise extended character
    THEN  TRUE             \ normal extended ASCII char.
;

VARIABLE PENDING-CHAR   -1 PENDING-CHAR !

: KEY?  ( -- flag )
    PENDING-CHAR @ 0&lt; IF
      BEGIN  EKEY? WHILE
        EKEY EKEY&gt;CHAR IF
          PENDING-CHAR !  TRUE EXIT
        THEN DROP
      REPEAT  FALSE EXIT
    THEN  TRUE
;

: KEY  ( -- char )
    PENDING-CHAR @ 0&lt; IF
      BEGIN  EKEY  EKEY>CHAR 0=
      WHILE
        DROP
      REPEAT  EXIT
    THEN  PENDING-CHAR @  -1 PENDING-CHAR !
;
</PRE>

<P>

This is a full-featured implementation, providing the application
program with an easy way to either handle non-character events (with
EKEY), or to ignore them and to only consider <B>real</B> characters
(with 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1750>KEY</a>).

<P>

Note that EKEY maps scan codes from 0 to 255 into numbers from 256 to
511.  EKEY maps the number 259, representing the keyboard combination
Ctrl-Shift-@, to the character whose numerical value is 0 (ASCII NUL).
Many ASCII keyboards generate ASCII NUL for Ctrl-Shift-@, so we use that
key combination for ASCII NUL (which is otherwise unavailable from
MS-DOS, because the zero byte signifies that another scan-code byte
follows).

<P>

One consequence of using the <B>Direct STDIN Input</B> system call
(function 7) instead of the <B>STDIN Input</B> system call (function 8)
is that the normal DOS <B>Ctrl-C interrupt</B> behavior is disabled when
the system is waiting for input (Ctrl-C would still cause an interrupt
while characters are being output).  On the other hand, if the <B>STDIN
Input</B> system call (function 8) were used to implement EKEY, Ctrl-C
interrupts would be enabled, but Ctrl-Shift-@ would also cause an
interrupt, because the operating system would treat the second byte of
the 0,3 sequence as a Ctrl-C, even though the 3 is really a scan code
and not a character.  One <B>best of both worlds</B> solution is to use
function 8 for the first byte received by EKEY, and function 7 for the
scan code byte.  For example:

<PRE>
: EKEY  ( -- u )
    DOS-KEY-FUNCTION-8  ?DUP  0=  IF
      DOS-KEY-FUNCTION-7 DUP 3  =  IF
        DROP 0  ELSE  256 +
      THEN
    THEN
;
</PRE>

<P>

Of course, if the Forth implementor chooses to pass Ctrl-C through to
the program, without using it for its usual interrupt function, then DOS
function 7 is appropriate in both cases (and some additional care must
be taken to prevent a typed-ahead Ctrl-C from interrupting the Forth
system during output operations).

<P>

A Forth system might also choose a simpler implementation of KEY,
without implementing EKEY, as follows:

<PRE>
: KEY   ( -- char )  DOS-KEY  ;

: KEY?  ( -- flag )  DOS-KEY? 0&lt;&gt;  ;
</PRE>

<P>

The disadvantages of the simpler version are:

<P>

a) An application program that uses KEY, expecting to receive only valid
characters, might receive a sequence of bytes (e.g., a zero byte
followed by a byte with the same numerical value as the letter <B>A</B>)
that appears to contain a valid character, even though the user pressed
a key (e.g., function key 4) that does not correspond to any valid
character.

<P>

b) An application program that wishes to handle non-character events
will have to execute KEY twice if it returns zero the first time.  This
might appear to be a reasonable and easy thing to do.  However, such
code is not portable to other systems that do not use a zero byte as an
<B>escape</B> code.  Using the EKEY approach, the algorithm for handling
keyboard events can be the same for all systems; the system dependencies
can be reduced to a table or set of constants listing the
system-dependent key codes used to access particular application
functions.  Without EKEY, the algorithm, not just the table, is likely
to be system dependent.

<P>

Another approach to EKEY on MS-DOS is to use the BIOS <B>Read Keyboard
Status</B> function (Interrupt 16h, Function 01h) or the related
<B>Check Keyboard</B> function (Interrupt 16h, Function 11h).  The
advantage of this function is that it allows the program to distinguish
between different keys that correspond to the same character (e.g.  the
two <B>1</B> keys).  The disadvantage is that the BIOS keyboard
functions read only the keyboard.  They cannot be <B>redirected</B> to
another <B>standard input</B> source, as can the DOS STDIN Input
functions.

EKEY&gt;CHAR
</a>
<P>

EKEY&gt;CHAR translates a keyboard event into the corresponding member of
the character set, if such a correspondence exists for that event.

<P>

It is possible that several different keyboard events may correspond to
the same character, and other keyboard events may correspond to no
character.

An indefinite delay is a device related condition, such as printer
off-line, that requires operator intervention before the device will
accept new data.

Although their frequencies vary, every system has a clock.  Since many
programs need to time intervals, this word is offered.  Use of
milliseconds as an internal unit of time is a practical <B>least common
denominator</B> external unit.  It is assumed implementors will use
<B>clock ticks</B> (whatever size they are) as an internal unit and
convert as appropriate.
