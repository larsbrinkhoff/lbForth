Dear Elizabeth:

<p>In the course of writing a test suite for the FILE wordset, I've discovered
that the <a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.2090>READ-LINE</a> definition is glaringly 
incomplete.  For this reason,
I am submitting this request for clarification (I assume that email is
sufficient; I don't recall that a more formal process is required).


<p>Request for clarification:

<pre>
<a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.2090>11.6.1.2090</a> 
READ-LINE 
( c-addr u1 fileid -- u2 flag ior)
</pre>

What is the meaning of "flag"?  The rationale suggests that it is
an end-of-file flag (or not-end-of-file from the behavior documented
in the definition), but this is not clear from the definition.

<p>What happens if the end of the file is encountered while reading a
line?  The definition states that "If the operation succeeded, flag
is true and ior is zero", but success is not defined.  I assume that
success is either that u1 characters were read or that a line terminator
was encountered.

<p>Suggested resolution:  flag is true unless the end-of-file is encountered,
in which case it is false.  ior does not reflect whether the
end-of-file was encountered or not.

<p>
--Loring

In the following excerpt from the definition of 
<a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.2090>READ-LINE</a> 
, the word "if"
means "If and only if".

<b><blockquote>
If the operation is initiated when the value returned by 
<a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.1520>FILE-POSITION</a>
is equal to the value returned by 
<a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.1522>FILE-SIZE</a> for the file identified
by fileid, flag is false ...
</blockquote></b>



<i><blockquote>
What happens if the end of the file is encountered while reading a
line?  The definition states that "If the operation succeeded, flag
is true and ior is zero", but success is not defined.  I assume that
success is either that u1 characters were read or that a line terminator
was encountered.
</blockquote></i>

"success" means that one of the following situations occurred:

<ol>
<li>Some non-terminator characters were read into the buffer or

<li>A line with a valid terminator sequence, but no characters other
than the terminator sequence, was read.  In this case, u2=0,
flag=true, and ior=zero.
</ol>

Specifically, if the last line in the file is non-empty, but has no
terminator, an attempt to read that line will "succeed", returning the
number of characters thus read, and flag will be true.  The next
read, assuming that no intervening 
<a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.2142>REPOSITION-FILE</a> occurs, will return
u2=0, flag=false, ior=false.

<p>Here is complete list of return value combinations and their meanings:

<pre>
u2	flag	ior	Meaning
--	----	---	-------
X	X	nonzero	Something bad and unexpected happened
			(end-of-file is not "unexpected")

0	false	zero	End-of-file; no characters were read

0	true	zero	A blank line was read

0&lt;u2&lt;u1	true	zero	The entire line was read

u1	true	zero	A partial line was read; the rest would
			not fit in the buffer, and can be acquired
			by additional calls to <a href=dpans11.htm#11.6.1.2090>READ-LINE</a>.
</pre>
