Request for Clairification.
</pre>

I have found the following references to *Text interpreter input number
conversion*.

<p>
The input of Floating-Point numbers is clear, my need for clairification is
with double-cell numbers:

<p>
Will a number with an *embedded* decimal point be converted to a double-cell
number in a Standard Forth system?

<p>
If not, what about <a href=dpansa12.htm#A.12.3.7>A.12.3.7</a> *...should treat numbers that have an embedded
decimal point, but no exponent, as floating-point numbers rather than double
cell numbers. This suggestion, although it has merit, has always been voted
down because it would break too much existing code;* ?

<p>
Is <a href=dpans8.htm#8.3.2>8.3.2</a> an example or the rule? ( a decimal point at the end)

<blockquote>
<a href=dpans8.htm#8.3.2>8.3.2</a> Text interpreter input number conversion

<p>
When the text interpreter processes a number that is immediately followed by
a decimal point and is not found as a definition name, the text interpreter
shall convert it to a double-cell number.
For example, entering <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1170>DECIMAL</a> 1234 leaves the single-cell number 1234 on the
stack, and entering <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1170>DECIMAL</a> 1234. leaves the double-cell number 1234 0 on the
stack.

<p>
See: <a href=dpans3.htm#3.4.1.3>3.4.1.3</a> Text interpreter input number conversion.

<p>
<a href=dpans12.htm#12.3.7>12.3.7</a> Text interpreter input number conversion

<p>
If the Floating-Point word set is present in the dictionary and the current
base is <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1170>DECIMAL</a>, the input number-conversion algorithm shall be extended to
recognize floating-point numbers in this form:

<pre>
Convertible string := &lt;significand&gt;&lt;exponent&gt;
&lt;significand&gt; := [&lt;sign&gt;]&lt;digits&gt;[.&lt;digits0&gt;]
&lt;exponent&gt; := E[&lt;sign&gt;]&lt;digits0&gt;
&lt;sign&gt; := { + | - }
&lt;digits&gt; := &lt;digit&gt;&lt;digits0&gt;
&lt;digits0&gt; := &lt;digit&gt;*
&lt;digit&gt; := { 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 }
</pre>

These are examples of valid representations of floating-point numbers in
program source:

<pre>
1E   1.E   1.E0   +1.23E-1   -1.23E+1
</pre>

See: <a href=dpans3.htm#3.4.1.3>3.4.1.3</a> Text interpreter input number conversion, <a href=dpans12.htm#12.6.1.0558>12.6.1.0558</a> <a href=dpans12.htm#12.6.1.0558>>FLOAT</a>.

<p>
<a href=dpansa12.htm#A.12.3.7>A.12.3.7</a> Text interpreter input number conversion

<p>
The Technical Committee has more than once received the suggestion that the
text interpreter in Standard Forth systems should treat numbers that have an
embedded decimal point, but no exponent, as floating-point numbers rather
than double cell numbers. This suggestion, although it has merit, has always
been voted down because it would break too much existing code; many existing
implementations put the full digit string on the stack as a double number and
use other means to inform the application of the location of the decimal
point.

Not necessarily.  A Standard System is permitted, but not required, to
convert digit strings with embedded periods as double numbers.
Consequently, a Standard Program cannot rely on any particular
interpretation of such digit strings.

<i><blockquote>
If not, what about <a href=dpansa12.htm#A.12.3.7>A.12.3.7</a> *...should treat numbers that have an embedded

<a href=dpansa12.htm#A.12.3.7>A.12.3.7</a> would be clearer if it read:
The Technical Committee has more than once received the suggestion that
the text interpreter in Standard Forth systems should treat numbers
that have an embedded decimal point, but no exponent, as floating-point
numbers.  This suggestion, although it has merit, has always been voted
down because it would break too much existing code; many existing
implementations put the full digit string on the stack as a double
number and use other means to inform the application of the location of
the decimal point.

Note that the only change I made was to delete the phrase "rather than
double cell numbers" from the first sentence <a href=dpansa12.htm#A.12.3.7>A.12.3.7</a>.  The original
sentence implies that numbers with an embedded decimal point and no
exponent are converted to double numbers in a Standard System.  The
intent of the committee was to allow this behavior in a Standard
System, but not to require it.

<i><blockquote>
Is <a href=dpans8.htm#8.3.2>8.3.2</a> an example or the rule? ( a decimal point at the end)
</blockquote></i>

It is the rule.

<i><blockquote>
<a href=dpans8.htm#8.3.2>8.3.2</a> Text interpreter input number conversion

<p>
When the text interpreter processes a number that is immediately followed by
a decimal point and is not found as a definition name, the text interpreter
shall convert it to a double-cell number.

<p>
For example, entering <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1170>DECIMAL</a> 1234 leaves the single-cell number 1234 on the
stack, and entering <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1170>DECIMAL</a> 1234. leaves the double-cell number 1234 0 on
the stack.

Negative vote from Dave Harralson on Letter Ballot 15, with the following
comment:

     I disagree with the response, "not necessarily...."  Section <a href=dpans8.htm#8.3.2>8.3.2</a> clearly
     states that a number with a decimal point that is not in the dictionary
     will be converted to a double-cell number.  If this section is revised,
     I vote yes.

[8.3.2  Text Interpreter Input number conversion
        When the text interpreter process a number that is *immediately
        followed* by a decimal point and is not found as a definition name,
        the text interpreter shall convert it to a double-cell number.]
