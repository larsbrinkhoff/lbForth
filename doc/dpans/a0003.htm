I'm not sure whether doing the following is legal ANS FORTH so I was
looking for someone to provide an interpretation as to whether it is
legal and if not why not.

<p>
Here is my problem.  Define the following:

<pre>
  \ Add selx to search order and make new definitions go into selx.
: set-current-wordlist  ( selx -- )
  >r get-order 1+ r> swap set-order definitions ;

  \ Fill wordlist with default definitions.
: fill-wordlist  ( n n n -- )
  s" constant a" evaluate
  s" constant b" evaluate
  s" constant c" evaluate ;

  \ Create new wordlist with default definitions.
: create-wordlist  ( -- )
  create
    wordlist set-current-wordlist
    1 2 3 fill-wordlist
  does>            ( body -- )
    set-current-wordlist ;
  

  \ Create new wordlist with default definitions, revised.
: create-wl  ( -- )
  wordlist dup set-current-wordlist
  1 2 3 fill-wordlist
  previous definitions
  create
    dup , set-current-wordlist
  does>      ( body -- )
    @ set-current-wordlist ;
</pre>

I believe that the above words set-current-wordlist and fill-wordlist by
themselves conform to the standard.  My problem lies with the word
create-wordlist.  Create-wordlist tries to create a defining word which
creates a wordlist, adds the newly created wordlist to the search order,
set the current definitions to go into the newly created wordlist, then
fills the wordlist with some common definitions.

<p>
When the word create-wordlist is executed (ie. create-wordlist abc) it
produces a new (ie. abc) which PFE, an ANS FORTH, is marked in the
dictionary as a variable -- not a defining word and c in the newly
created wordlist is marked in its dictionary as a defining word -- not
a constant!  As far as I can tell from the standard, this could be a
result of does> (section 6.1.1250) replacing the execution semantics of
the most recent definition, ie. abc which was defined by create, and the
fact that fill-wordlist creates new definitions.  It seems that section
"3.4.5 Compilation" of the standard may apply somehow as well.

<p>
The standard seems unclear to me when it says that: "does> replaces the
execution semantics of the most recent definition."  I would have expected
it to use the term "current definition" from "2.1 Definitions of terms."
But again whether its "recent definition" or "current definition" it really
says to me: "replaces the execution semantics of the most recent/current
definition [in the most recent/current definition's wordlist]".  Note I
added the bracketed item to show what the standard implies to me.  However
it is clear that PFE, an ANS FORTH, implies "in the current wordlist where
definitions are being placed."

<p>
It's unclear in the standard, to me, which one is correct.  Given the
ambiguity I rewrote the word create-wordlist and it appears as the word
create-wl.  The new word create-wl now creates the wordlist fills it with
the common definitions and restores the previous wordlist.  Then create-wl 
*creates* the defining word.  This seems to work for PFE but may not work
for other ANS implementations.  However, this points out another possible
problem with the definitions of create-wordlist and create-wl.

<p>
The newly perceived problem is that both words change the search order before
the does> is done.  It seems to me that sections <a href=dpans16.htm#16.3.3>16.3.3</a> and <a href=dpansa16.htm#A.16.3.3>A.16.3.3</a> say that
this produces an ambiguous condition.  Is this correct?  Does <a href=dpans16.htm#16.3.3>16.3.3</a> refer
to when the word create-wordlist is being compiled or the word being defined
by create-wordlist?

<p>
My final question is: "Is it possible to portably create a defining word
which creates a wordlist, fills that wordlist with definitions and then
switches the search order to that wordlist with the current ANS standard?"

<hr>
The following sections from the ANS standard, which I thought were
relevant to the problem, are quoted below for your convience:

<blockquote>
<a href=dpans2.htm#2.1>2.1</a> Definitions of terms 

<dl>

<dt>
ambiguous condition: 

<dd>
  A circumstance for which this Standard does not prescribe a specific
  behavior for Forth systems and programs. 

<p>
  Ambiguous conditions include such things as the absence of a needed
  delimiter while parsing, attempted access to a nonexistent file, or
  attempted use of a nonexistent word. An ambiguous condition also exists
  when a Standard word is passed values that are improper or out of range. 

<dt>
current definition: 

<dd>
  The definition whose compilation has been started but not yet ended. 

<dt>
defining word: 

<dd>
  A Forth word that creates a new definition when executed. 

<dt>

<dd>
  A Forth execution procedure compiled into the dictionary. 

<dt>

<dd>
  An extensible structure that contains definitions and associated
  data space. 
</dl>

<p>
A program shall not attempt to nest compilation of definitions. 

<p>
During the compilation of the current definition, a program shall
not execute any defining word, <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0455>:NONAME</a>, or any definition that
allocates dictionary data space. The compilation of the current
definition may be suspended using <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2500>[</a> (left-bracket) and resumed
using <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2540>]</a> (right-bracket). While the compilation of the current
definition is suspended, a program shall not execute any defining
word, <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0455>:NONAME</a>, or any definition that allocates dictionary data space. 

<p>

<p>
Interpretation: Interpretation semantics for this word are undefined. 

<p>
Compilation: ( C: colon-sys1 -- colon-sys2 ) 

<p>
Append the run-time semantics below to the current definition. Whether
or not the current definition is rendered findable in the dictionary by
the compilation of <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> is implementation defined. Consume colon-sys1
and produce colon-sys2. Append the initiation semantics given below to
the current definition. 

<p>
Run-time: ( -- ) ( R: nest-sys1 -- ) 

<p>
Replace the execution semantics of the most recent definition, referred
to as name, with the name execution semantics given below. Return control
to the calling definition specified by nest-sys1. An ambiguous condition
exists if name was not defined with <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a> or a user-defined word that
calls <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a>. 

<p>
Initiation: ( i*x -- i*x a-addr ) ( R: -- nest-sys2 ) 

<p>
Save implementation-dependent information nest-sys2 about the calling
definition. Place name's data field address on the stack. The stack
effects i*x represent arguments to name. 

<p>
name Execution: ( i*x -- j*x ) 

<p>
Execute the portion of the definition that begins with the initiation
semantics appended by the <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> which modified name. The stack effects
i*x and j*x represent arguments to and results from name, respectively. 


<p>
<a href=dpans16.htm#16.3.3>16.3.3</a> Finding definition names 

<p>
An ambiguous condition exists if a program changes the compilation word
list during the compilation of a definition or before modification of the
behavior of the most recently compiled definition with <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.2.0470>;CODE</a>, <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a>, or

<i><blockquote>
Here is my problem.  Define the following:

<pre>
  \ Add selx to search order and make new definitions go into selx.
: set-current-wordlist  ( selx -- )
  >r get-order 1+ r> swap set-order definitions ;
</pre>
</blockquote></i>

        set-current-wordlist is standard Forth in the given context,
i.e. as a definition commenced while the system is interpretive
mode. Note that it has a dependency on the SEARCH-ORDER Word Set with
Extensions.

<p>
        Incidentally, the Technical Committee encourages the use of
uppercase for Standard words in clarification queries submitted to
X3J14.

<i><blockquote>
<pre>
  \ Fill wordlist with default definitions.
: fill-wordlist  ( n n n -- )
  s" constant a" evaluate
  s" constant b" evaluate
  s" constant c" evaluate ;
</pre>
</blockquote></i>

        fill-wordlist is standard Forth in the given context.

<i><blockquote>
<pre>
  \ Create new wordlist with default definitions.
: create-wordlist  ( -- )
  create
    wordlist set-current-wordlist
    1 2 3 fill-wordlist
  does>            ( body -- )
    set-current-wordlist ;
</pre>
</blockquote></i>

        This definition of create-wordlist is erroneous as later
noted by its author: the wordlist-id is not preserved so that
the body address returned by words can be dereferenced to
the (should have been) stored wordlist-id for set-current wordlist.

<p>
        But this flaw conceals the definition's intent, to effect
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a>, change the compilation wordlist, add definitions, then return
to the original compilation wordlist and effect <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a>. This is not
Standard Forth.

<p>
         Words cannot be added to the dictionary between the action of
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> and the most recent action of <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a>. <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> modifies a word
created by <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a>. <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> modifies the most recent definition. Thus
there can have been no new definition added to the dictionary which
was not created by <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a> immediately prior to a <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a>. Note that
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> is found in the Core word set and never modified later in the
Standard when the concept of multiple compilation wordlists is
introduced.

<p>
        Although the Standard does not preclude implementations using
multiple wordlists from having "most recent" definitions in each
wordset, the definition of <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> is not extended to provide for
multiple wordlists, and makes no provision for other than a single
"most recent" definition.  The clear intent of the Standard is that
words cannot be added to the dictionary between the action of <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a>
and the most recent action of <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a>.

<p>
        (Also note that the execution of <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.1.2460>WORDLIST</a> may consume data
space, altering the address returned by <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1650>HERE</a>. The portable program
must avoid executing <a href=dpans16.htm#16.6.1.2460>WORDLIST</a> between <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a> and the execution of
 <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0150>,</a> "comma" that saves the wordlist ID in the body of the created
definition. Otherwise, the CREATE'd, DOES>'d entity at runtime will
point at space which subsequently might have been used for the
WORDLIST.)

<p>
        The following was suggested as an improvement the the original
definition of create-wordlist.

<i><blockquote>
<pre>
  \ Create new wordlist with default definitions, revised.
: create-wl  ( name< > -- )
  wordlist dup set-current-wordlist
  1 2 3 fill-wordlist
  previous definitions
  create
    dup , set-current-wordlist
  does>      ( body -- )
    @ set-current-wordlist ;
</pre>
</blockquote></i>

<p>
        This definition create-wl at runtime changes the compilation
wordlist [16.6.1.2195] between <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a> [6.1.1000] and <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> [6.1.1250].
The Forth Standard, <a href=dpans16.htm#16.3.3>16.3.3</a> para 4:

<p>
"An ambiguous condition exists if a program changes the compilation
word list during the compilation of a definition or before modi-
fication of the behavior of the most recently compiled definition
with <a href=dpans15.htm#15.6.2.0470>;CODE</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> or IMMEDIATE."

<p>
        Therefore, while not "non-Standard", the amended definition
create-wl exhibits a platform dependency on the particular resolution
of the ambiguity selected by the hosting Standard System, if create-wl
is to execute deterministically.

<i><blockquote>
My final question is: "Is it possible to portably create a defining word
which creates a wordlist, fills that wordlist with definitions and then
switches the search order to that wordlist with the current ANS standard?"
</blockquote></i>

        Yes.

<p>
From the point of view of CREATE-WORDLIST at runtime, 78-VOCABULARY is
atomic. Its work is done before the change in search order occurs for
the first time. Good factoring avoids a grey area of the Standard.

<p>
        Greg Bailey notes that during the mailing list discussion of
this issue, he erroneously posted using <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2410>VARIABLE</a> where <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a> was
intended. Greg regrets any confusion thus caused.
