[Co-author Elizabeth Rather <erather@forth.com> adds:]

<p>
You will see it in <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>6.1.1250</a> <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> as well.  This describes the behavior of
a word defined by <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0450>:</a> or a <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a> word when it begins to execute.  The
realization that this should be specified separately came rather late in
the process, and I believe you are correct that we have not defined this
term adequately.  I am referring your comment to the TC to see whether they
feel something should be done, such as publishing a clarification.

<p>Thank you for calling it to our attention.

It is noted that the Technical Committee included, in Section <a href=dpans2.htm#2.1>2.1</a> of the
standard, definitions of the terms "compilation semantics" and "execution
semantics".

<p>
For similar reasons, the TC agrees that the standard should also include a
definition of the term "initiation semantics" in Section <a href=dpans2.htm#2.1>2.1</a> Definitions
of Terms:

<dl>
<dt>   initiation semantics:
<dd>      The behavior of a Forth definition, or of the portion of a
      Forth definition following <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a>, when it begins execution.
</dl>

By way of further clarification, when a definition begins execution, the
system may perform implementation-dependent actions such as placing items
on the return stack to allow return to a calling definition.  These actions
are invisible to a standard program except at certain points during the
execution of definitions created with <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0450>:</a> (colon) or <a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0455>:NONAME</a> and during the
execution of the code following <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a>.  At these points, the sole visible
result is the possible presence of the implementation-dependent _nest-sys_
on the return stack.

<p>
Within a given implementation, definitions created with <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0450>:</a> (colon) all have
the same initiation semantics.  Similarly for all definitions created with
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0455>:NONAME</a> or <a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a>.

"No" vote on LB16 from L. Zettel, with the following comment:

   | I agree with the explanation given for the meaning of "initiation

   |
   | I do not agree with the declaration of intent to add a formal
   | definition of "initiation semantics" to the Standard.
