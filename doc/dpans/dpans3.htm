<H1>3. Usage requirements</H1>

A system shall provide all of the words defined in 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1>6.1</a> Core Words.  It
may also provide any words defined in the optional word sets and
extensions word sets.  No standard word provided by a system shall alter
the system state in a way that changes the effect of execution of any
other standard word except as provided in this Standard.  A system may
contain non-standard extensions, provided that they are consistent with
the requirements of this Standard.

<P>

The implementation of a system may use words and techniques outside the
scope of this Standard.

<P>

A system need not provide all words in executable form.  The
implementation may provide definitions, including definitions of words
in the Core word set, in source form only.  If so, the mechanism for
adding the definitions to the dictionary is implementation defined.

<P>

A program that requires a system to provide words or techniques not
defined in this Standard has an environmental dependency.

<H2>3.1 Data types</H2>
</a>

A data type identifies the set of permissible values for a data object.
It is not a property of a particular storage location or position on a
stack.  Moving a data object shall not affect its type.

<P>

No data-type checking is required of a system.  An ambiguous condition
exists if an incorrectly typed data object is encountered.

<P>

<a href=dpans3.htm#table.3.1>Table 3.1</a> summarizes the data types used throughout this Standard.
Multiple instances of the same type in the description of a definition
are suffixed with a sequence digit subscript to distinguish them.

<H3>3.1.1 Data-type relationships</H3>
</a>

Some of the data types are subtypes of other data types.  A data type i
is a subtype of type j if and only if the members of i are a subset of
the members of j.  The following list represents the subtype
relationships using the phrase <B>i =&gt; j</B> to denote <B>i is a subtype
of j</B>.  The subtype relationship is transitive; if i =&gt; j and j =&gt; k
then i =&gt; k:

<PRE>
	+n => u => x;
	+n => n => x;
	char => +n;
	a-addr => c-addr => addr => u;
	flag => x;
	xt => x;
	+d => d => xd;
	+d => ud => xd.

<P>

Any Forth definition that accepts an argument of type i shall also accept an
argument that is a subtype of i.

<H3>3.1.2 Character types</H3>
</a>

Characters shall be at least one address unit wide, contain at least eight
bits, and have a size less than or equal to cell size.

<P>

The characters provided by a system shall include the graphic characters
{32..126}, which represent graphic forms as shown in 
<a href=dpans3.htm#table.3.2>table 3.2</a>.

<H2>3.1.2.1 Graphic characters</H2>
</a>

A graphic character is one that is normally displayed (e.g., A, #, &, 6).
These values and graphics, shown in 
<a href=dpans3.htm#table.3.2>table 3.2</a>, are taken directly from ANS
X3.4-1974 (ASCII) and ISO 646-1983, International Reference Version (IRV).
The graphic forms of characters outside the hex range {20..7E} are
implementation-defined.  Programs that use the graphic hex 24 (the currency
sign) have an environmental dependency.

<P>

The graphic representation of characters is not restricted to particular type
fonts or styles.  The graphics here are examples.

<P>

<hr>
<A name=3.1.2.2>
<H4>3.1.2.2 Control characters</H4>
</a>

All non-graphic characters included in the implementation-defined character
set are defined in this Standard as control characters.  In particular, the
characters {0..31}, which could be included in the implementation-defined
character set, are control characters.

<P>

Programs that require the ability to send or receive control characters have
an environmental dependency.

decimal value nine corresponding to the character <B>9</B>.  For digits
beginning with the decimal value ten the graphic characters beginning

<H4>3.2.2.1 Integer division</H4>
</a>

Division produces a quotient q and a remainder r by dividing operand a
by operand b.  Division operations return q, r, or both.  The identity
b*q + r = a shall hold for all a and b.

<P>

When unsigned integers are divided and the remainder is not zero, q is
the largest integer less than the true quotient.

<P>

When signed integers are divided, the remainder is not zero, and a and b
have the same sign, q is the largest integer less than the true
quotient.  If only one operand is negative, whether q is rounded toward
negative infinity (floored division) or rounded towards zero (symmetric
division) is implementation defined.

<P>

Floored division is integer division in which the remainder carries the
sign of the divisor or is zero, and the quotient is rounded to its
arithmetic floor.  Symmetric division is integer division in which the
remainder carries the sign of the dividend or is zero and the quotient
is the mathematical quotient <B>rounded towards zero</B> or
<B>truncated</B>.  Examples of each are shown in tables 
<a href=dpans3.htm#table.3.3>3.3</a> and 
<a href=dpans3.htm#table.3.3>3.4</a>.

<P>

In cases where the operands differ in sign and the rounding direction
matters, a program shall either include code generating the desired form
of division, not relying on the implementation-defined default result,
or have an environmental dependency on the desired rounding direction.

Forth words are organized into a structure called the dictionary.  While
the form of this structure is not specified by the Standard, it can be

<H4>3.3.3.1 Address alignment</H4>

Most addresses used in ANS Forth are aligned addresses (indicated by
a-addr) or character-aligned (indicated by c-addr).  
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0706>ALIGNED</a>, 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0897>CHAR+</a>, and
arithmetic operations can alter the alignment state of an address on the
stack.  CHAR+ applied to an aligned address returns a character-aligned
address that can only be used to access characters.  Applying CHAR+ to a
character-aligned address produces the succeeding character-aligned
address.  Adding or subtracting an arbitrary number to an address can
produce an unaligned address that shall not be used to fetch or store
anything.  The only way to find the next aligned address is with
ALIGNED.  An ambiguous condition exists when

the following paragraphs apply.  The data-space pointer 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1650>HERE</a> 
always
identifies the beginning of the next data-space region to be allocated.
As successive allocations are made, the data-space pointer increases.  A
program may perform address arithmetic within contiguously allocated
regions.  The last region of data space allocated using the above
operators may be released by allocating a corresponding negatively-sized
region using ALLOT, subject to the restrictions of the following
paragraphs.

<P>

<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a> 
establishes the beginning of a contiguous region of data space,
whose starting address is returned by the CREATEd definition.  This

<P>

Since an implementation is free to allocate data space for use by code,
the above operators need not produce contiguous regions of data space if
definitions are added to or removed from the dictionary between
allocations.  An ambiguous condition exists if deallocated memory

A program may modify the size of the parse area by changing the contents

<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0560>&gt;IN</a> 
within the limits imposed by this Standard.  For example, if the
contents of &gt;IN are saved before a parsing operation and restored
afterwards, the text that was parsed will be available again for
subsequent parsing operations.  The extent of permissible repositioning
using this method depends on the input 
source (see <a href=dpans7.htm#7.3.3>7.3.3</a> Block buffer

<P>

A program may directly examine the input buffer using its address and
length as returned by SOURCE; the beginning of the parse area within the
input buffer is indexed by the number in >IN.  The values are valid for
a limited time.  An ambiguous condition exists if a program modifies the

The size of the scratch area whose address is returned by PAD shall be
at least 84 characters.  The contents of the region addressed by PAD are
intended to be under the complete control of the user: no words defined
in this Standard place anything in the region, although changing
data-space allocations as described in 
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.3.3.2>3.3.3.2</a> Contiguous regions may
change the address returned by PAD.  Non-standard words provided by an
implementation may use PAD, but such use shall be documented.

<P>

The size of the region identified by WORD shall be at least 33
characters.

<P>

The size of the pictured numeric output string buffer shall be at least
(2*n) + 2 characters, where n is the number of bits in a cell.  Programs
that consider it a fixed area with unchanging access parameters have an
environmental dependency.

<H2>3.4 The Forth text interpreter</H2>
</a>

Upon start-up, a system shall be able to interpret, as described by
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2050>6.1.2050</a> QUIT, Forth source code 
received interactively from a user
input device.

<P>

Such interactive systems usually furnish a <B>prompt</B> indicating that
they have accepted a user request and acted on it.  The
implementation-defined Forth prompt should contain the word <B>OK</B> in
some combination of upper or lower case.

<P>

Text interpretation (see 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1360>6.1.1360</a> EVALUATE and 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2050>6.1.2050</a> QUIT) shall
repeat the following steps until either the parse area is empty or an
ambiguous condition exists:

<p>
a) Skip leading spaces and parse a name (see 
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.4.1>3.4.1</a>);
<p>
b) Search the dictionary name space (see 
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.4.2>3.4.2</a>). If a definition name
matching the string is found:
<OL>
<LI>if interpreting, perform the interpretation semantics of the
definition (see 
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.4.3.2>3.4.3.2</a>), and continue at a);
<LI>if compiling, perform the compilation semantics of the definition (see
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.4.3.3>3.4.3.3</a>), and continue at a).
</ol>
<p>
c) If a definition name matching the string is not found, attempt to
convert the string to a number (see 
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.4.1.3>3.4.1.3</a>). If successful:
<ol>
<LI>if interpreting, place the number on the data stack, and continue at a);
<LI>if compiling, compile code that when executed will place the number on
the stack (see 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1780>6.1.1780</a> LITERAL), and continue at a);
</ol>
<p>
d) If unsuccessful, an ambiguous condition exists (see 
<a href=dpans3.htm#3.4.4>3.4.4</a>).

<H3>3.4.1 Parsing</H3>
</a>

Unless otherwise noted, the number of characters parsed may be from zero
to the implementation-defined maximum length of a counted string.

<P>

If the parse area is empty, i.e., when the number in 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0560>&gt;IN</a> 
is equal to the
length of the input buffer, or contains no characters other than
delimiters, the selected string is empty.  Otherwise, the selected
string begins with the next character in the parse area, which is the
character indexed by the contents of &gt;IN.  An ambiguous condition exists
if the number in &gt;IN is greater than the size of the input buffer.

<P>

If delimiter characters are present in the parse area after the
beginning of the selected string, the string continues up to and
including the character just before the first such delimiter, and the
number in &gt;IN is changed to index immediately past that delimiter, thus
removing the parsed characters and the delimiter from the parse area.
Otherwise, the string continues up to and including the last character
in the parse area, and the number in &gt;IN is changed to the length of the
input buffer, thus emptying the parse area.

<P>

Parsing may change the contents of &gt;IN, but shall not affect the
contents of the input buffer.  Specifically, if the value in &gt;IN is
saved before starting the parse, resetting &gt;IN to that value immediately
after the parse shall restore the parse area without loss of data.

<H4>3.4.1.1 Delimiters</H4>
</a>

If the delimiter is the space character, hex 20 
(<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0770>BL</a>), 
control characters
may be treated as delimiters.  The set of conditions, if any, under
which a <B>space</B> delimiter matches control characters is
implementation defined.

<P>

To skip leading delimiters is to pass by zero or more contiguous
delimiters in the parse area before parsing.

<H4>3.4.1.2 Syntax</H4>
</a>

Forth has a simple, operator-ordered syntax.  The phrase A B C returns
values as if A were executed first, then B and finally C.  Words that
cause deviations from this linear flow of control are called
control-flow words.  Combinations of control-flow words whose stack
effects are compatible form control-flow structures.  Examples of
typical use are given for each control-flow word in
<A href=dpansa1.htm>Annex A</A>.

<P>

Forth syntax is extensible; for example, new control-flow words can be
defined in terms of existing ones.

<P>

This Standard does not require a
syntax or program-construct checker.

<P>

<hr>
<A name=3.4.1.3>
<H4>3.4.1.3 Text interpreter input number conversion</H4>
</a>

When converting input numbers, the text interpreter shall recognize both
positive and negative numbers, with a negative number represented by a
single minus sign, the character <B>-</B>, preceding the digits.  The
value in 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.0750>BASE</a> 
is the radix for number conversion.

<H3>3.4.2 Finding definition names</H3>
</a>

A string matches a definition name if each character in the string
matches the corresponding character in the string used as the definition
name when the definition was created.  The case sensitivity (whether or
not the upper-case letters match the lower-case letters) is
implementation defined.  A system may be either case sensitive, treating
upper- and lower-case letters as different and not matching, or case
insensitive, ignoring differences in case while searching.

<P>

The matching of upper- and lower-case letters with alphabetic characters
in character set extensions such as accented international characters is
implementation defined.

<P>

A system shall be capable of finding the definition names defined by
this Standard when they are spelled with upper-case letters.

<A name=3.4.3>
<H3>3.4.3 Semantics</H3>
</a>

The semantics of a Forth definition are implemented by machine code or a
sequence of execution tokens or other representations.  They are largely
specified by the stack notation in the glossary entries, which shows
what values shall be consumed and produced.  The prose in each glossary
entry further specifies the definition's behavior.

<P>

Each Forth definition may have several behaviors, described in the
following sections.  The terms <B>initiation semantics</B> and
<B>run-time semantics</B> refer to definition fragments, and have
meaning only within the individual glossary entries where they appear.

<P>

<H4>3.4.3.1 Execution semantics</H4>
</a>

The execution semantics of each Forth definition are specified in an
<B>Execution:</B> section of its glossary entry.  When a definition has
only one specified behavior, the label is omitted.

<P>

Execution may occur implicitly, when the definition into which it has
been compiled is executed, or explicitly, when its execution token is
passed to 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.1370>EXECUTE</a>.  
The execution semantics of a syntactically correct
definition under conditions other than those specified in this Standard
are implementation dependent.

<P>

Glossary entries for defining words include the execution semantics for
the new definition in a <i>name</i> <b>Execution:</B> section.

its execution semantics.

<P>

A system shall be capable of executing, in interpretation state, all of
the definitions from the Core word set and any definitions included from
the optional word sets or word set extensions whose interpretation
semantics are defined by this Standard.

A system shall be capable of executing, in interpretation state, any new
definitions created in accordance with

When an ambiguous condition exists, a system may take one or more of the
following actions:

<UL>
<LI>ignore and continue;
<LI>display a message;
<LI>execute a particular word;
<LI>set interpretation state and begin text interpretation;
<LI>take other implementation-defined actions;

<H3>3.4.5 Compilation</H3>
</a>

A program shall not attempt to
nest compilation of definitions.

<P>

During the compilation of the current definition, a program shall not
execute any defining word, 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0455>:NONAME</a>, 
or any definition that allocates
dictionary data space.  The compilation of the current definition may be
suspended using [ 
(<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2500>left-bracket</a>) 
and resumed using ] 
(<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1.2540>right-bracket</a>).
While the compilation of the current definition is suspended, a program
shall not execute any defining word, :NONAME, or any definition that
allocates dictionary data space.
