<H3>A.1.2 Scope</H3>
</a>

This Standard is more extensive than previous industry standards for the Forth
language.  Several things made this necessary:

<UL>
<LI>the desire to resolve conflicts between previous standards;
<LI>the need to eliminate semantic ambiguities and other inadequacies;
<LI>the requirement to standardize common practice, where possible
resolving divergences in a way that minimizes the cost of compliance;
<LI>the desire to standardize common system techniques, including those
germane to hardware.
</UL>
<P>

The result of the effort to satisfy all of these objectives is a
Standard arranged so that the required word set remains small.  Thus ANS
Forth can be provided for resource-constrained embedded systems.  Words
beyond those in the required word set are organized into a number of
optional word sets and their extensions, enabling implementation of
tailored systems that are Standard.

<P>

When judging relative merits, the members of the X3J14 Technical
Committee were guided by the following goals (listed in alphabetic
order):

<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Consistency</B>   
<DD>The Standard provides a functionally complete
set of words
with minimal functional overlap.

<DT><B>Cost of compliance</B>     
<DD>This goal includes such issues as common
practice, how
much existing code would be broken by the proposed change, and the amount of
effort required to bring existing applications and systems into conformity
with the Standard.

<DT><B>Efficiency</B>     
<DD>Execution speed, memory compactness.

<DT><B>Portability</B>    
<DD>Words chosen for inclusion should be free of
system-dependent
features.

<DT><B>Readability</B>    
<DD>Forth definition names should clearly delineate
their
behavior.  That behavior should have an apparent simplicity which supports
rapid understanding.  Forth should be easily taught and support readily
maintained code.

<DT><B>Utility</B> 
<DD>Be judged to have sufficiently essential functionality
and frequency
of use to be deemed suitable for inclusion.</DL>

<H4>A.1.3.1 Word sets</H4>
</a>

From the beginning, the X3J14 Technical Committee faced not only
conflicting ideas as to what <B>real</B> Forth is, but also conflicting
needs of the various groups within the Forth community.  At one extreme
were those who pressed for a <B>bare</B> Forth.  At the other extreme
were those who wanted a <B>fat</B> Forth.  Many were somewhere in
between.  All were convinced of the rightness of their own position and
of the wrongness of at least one of the two extremes.  The committee's
composition reflected this full range of interests.

<P>

The approach we have taken is to define a 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.1>Core word set</a> 
establishing a
greatest lower bound for required system functionality and to provide a
portfolio of optional word sets for special purposes.  This simple
approach parallels the fundamental nature of Forth as an extensible
language, and thereby achieves a kind of meta-extensibility.

<P>

With this key, high-level compromise, regardless of the actual makeup of
the individual word sets, a firm and workable framework is established
for the long term.  One may or may not agree that there should be a
<a href=dpans13.htm>Locals word set</a>, 
or that the word 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2.0945>COMPILE,</a> 
belongs in the 
<a href=dpans6.htm#6.2>Core Extensions word set</a>.  
But at least there is a mechanism whereby such
things can be included in a logical and orderly manner.

<P>

Several implications of this scheme of optional word sets are
significant.

<P>

First, ANS Forth systems can continue to be implemented on a greater
range of hardware than could be claimed by almost any other single
language.  Since only the 
Core word set is required, very limited
hardware will be able to accommodate an ANS Forth implementation.

<P>

Second, a greater degree of portability of applications, and of
programmers, is anticipated.  The optional word sets standardize various
functions (e.g., floating point) that were widely implemented before,
but not with uniform definition names and methodologies, nor the same
levels of completeness.  With such words now standardized in the
optional word sets, communications between programmers - verbally, via
magazine or journal articles, etc.  - will leap to a new level of
facility, and the shareability of code and applications should rise
dramatically.

<P>

Third, ANS Forth systems may be designed to offer the user the power to
selectively, even dynamically, include or exclude one or more of the
optional word sets or portions thereof.  Also, lower-priced products may
be offered for the user who needs the Core word set and not much more.
Thus, virtually unlimited flexibility will be available to the user.

<P>

But these advantages have a price.  The burden is on the user to decide
what capabilities are desired, and to select product offerings
accordingly, especially when portability of applications is important.
We do not expect most implementors to attempt to provide all word sets,
but rather to select those most valuable to their intended markets.

<P>

The basic requirement is that if the implementor claims to have a
particular optional word set the entire required portion of that word
set must be available.  If the implementor wishes to offer only part of
an optional word set, it is acceptable to say, for example, <B>This
system offers portions of the [named] word set</B>, particularly if the
selected or excluded words are itemized clearly.

<P>

Each optional word set will probably appeal to a particular
constituency.  For example, scientists performing complex mathematical
analysis may place a higher value on the 
<a href=dpans12.htm>Floating-Point word set</a> 
than
programmers developing simple embedded controllers.  As in the case of
the core extensions, we expect implementors to offer those word sets
they expect will be valued by their users.

<P>

Optional word sets may be offered in source form or otherwise factored
so that the user may selectively load them.

<P>

The extensions to the optional word sets include words which are deemed
less essential to performing the primary activity supported by the word
set, though clearly relevant to it.  As in the case of the Core
Extensions, implementors may selectively add itemized subsets of a word
set extension providing the labeling doesn't mislead the user into
thinking incorrectly that all words are present.
