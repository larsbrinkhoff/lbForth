          1.   FOREWORD




                                    1.   FOREWORD


          FORTH is an integrated programming approach and computer
          language.  FORTH was invented by Mr. Charles Moore specifically
          to increase programmer productivity in the development of
          computer related applications without sacrificing machine
          efficiency.  FORTH is a layered environment containing the
          elements of a computer language as well as those of an operating
          system and a machine monitor.  This extensible, layered
          environment provides for highly interactive program development
          and testing.

          In the interests of transportability of application software
          written in FORTH, standardization efforts began in the mid-1970s
          by the European FORTH User's Group (EFUG).  This effort resulted
          in the FORTH-77 Standard.  As the language continued to evolve,
          an interim FORTH-78 Standard was published by the FORTH Standards
          Team.  Following FORTH Standards Team meetings in 1979 the FORTH-
          79 Standard was published in 1980.

          The FORTH Standards Team is comprised of individuals who have a
          great variety of experience and technical expertise with FORTH.
          The FORTH Standards Team consists of both users and implementers.
          Comments, proposals, and correspondence should be mailed to:
          FORTH Standards Team, P.O. Box 4545, Mountain View, CA 94040 USA.

          FORTH's extensibility allows the language to be expanded and
          adapted to special needs and different hardware systems.  A
          programmer or vendor may choose to strictly adhere with the
          standard, but the choice to deviate is acknowledged as beneficial
          and sometimes necessary.  If the standard does not explicitly
          specify a requirement or restriction, a system or application may
          utilize any choice without sacrificing compliance to the standard
          provided that the system or application remains transportable and
          obeys the other requirements of the standard.

                                    2.   PURPOSE


          The purpose of this standard is to allow transportability of
          FORTH-83 Standard Programs in source form among FORTH-83 Standard
          Systems.  A standard program shall execute equivalently on all
          standard systems.



                                     3.   SCOPE


          This standard shall apply to any FORTH-83 Standard Program
          executing on any FORTH-83 Standard System, provided sufficient
          computer resources (memory, mass storage) are available.

                                   4.   TRADEOFFS


          When conflicting choices are made, the following order guides the
          Standards Team:

          1)   Functional correctness - known bounds, non-ambiguous;

          2)   Portability - repeatable results when programs are
               transported among Standard Systems;

          3)   Simplicity;

          4)   Naming clarity - uniformity of expression using descriptive
               rather than procedure names, i.e., [COMPILE] rather than 'C,
               and ALLOT rather than DP+! ;

          5)   Generality;

          6)   Execution speed;

          7)   Memory compactness;

          8)   Compilation speed;

          9)   Historical continuity;

          10)  Pronounceability;

          11)  Teachability.

                              5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


          These are the definitions of the terms used within this Standard.

          address, byte
               An unsigned 16-bit number that locates an 8-bit byte in a
               standard FORTH address space over the range {0..65,535}.  It
               may be a native machine address or a representation on a
               virtual machine, locating the addr-th byte within the
               virtual byte address space.  Addresses are treated as
               unsigned numbers.  See:  "arithmetic, two's complement"

          address, compilation
               The numerical value compiled for a FORTH word definition
               which identifies that definition.  The address interpreter
               uses this value to locate the machine code corresponding to
               each definition.

          address, native machine
               The natural address representation of the host computer.

          address, parameter field
               The address of the first byte of memory associated with a
               word definition for the storage of compilation addresses (in
               a colon definition), numeric data, text characters, etc.

          arithmetic, two's complement
               Arithmetic is performed using two's complement integers
               within a field of either 16 or 32 bits as indicated by the
               operation.  Addition and subtraction of two's complement
               integers ignore any overflow condition.  This allows numbers
               treated as unsigned to produce the same results as if the
               numbers had been treated as signed.

          block
               The 1024 bytes of data from mass storage which are
               referenced by block numbers in the range {0..the number of
               blocks available -1}.  The actual amount of data transferred
               and the translation from block number to device and physical
               record is a function of the implementation.  See:  "block
               buffer"  "mass storage"

          block buffer
               A 1024-byte memory area where a block is made temporarily
               available for use.  Block buffers are uniquely assigned to
               blocks.  See:  "9.7 Multiprogramming Impact"

          byte
               An assembly of 8 bits.  In reference to memory, it is the
               storage capacity for 8 bits.




                                          4





          5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


          character
               A 7-bit number the significance of which is given by the
               ASCII standard.  When contained in a larger field, the
               higher order bits are zero.  See:  "6. REFERENCES"

          compilation
               The action of converting text words from the input stream
               into an internal form suitable for later execution.  When in
               the compile state, the compilation addresses of FORTH words
               are compiled into the dictionary for later execution by the
               address interpreter.  Numbers are compiled to be placed on
               the data stack when later executed.  Numbers are accepted
               from the input stream unsigned or negatively signed and
               converted using the value of BASE .  See:  "number"  "number
               conversion"  "interpreter, text"

          defining word
               A word that, when executed, creates a new dictionary entry
               in the compilation vocabulary.  The new word name is taken
               from the input stream.  If the input stream is exhausted
               before the new name is available, an error condition exists.
               Example of defining words are:  :  CONSTANT  CREATE

          definition
               See:  "word definition"

          dictionary
               A structure of word definitions in computer memory which is
               extensible and grows toward higher memory addresses.
               Entries are organized in vocabularies to aid location by
               name.  See:  "search order"

          display
               The process of sending one or more characters to the current
               output device.  These characters are typically displayed or
               printed on a terminal.  The selection of the current output
               device is system dependent.

          division, floored
               Integer division in which the remainder carries the sign of
               the divisor or is zero, and the quotient is rounded to its
               arithmetic floor.  Note that, except for error conditions,
               n1 n2 SWAP OVER /MOD ROT * + is identical to n1.  See:
               "floor, arithmetic" 
               Examples:
                    dividend  divisor  remainder  quotient

          5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


               A standard program will produce the same results, exclusive
               of timing dependencies, when given the same inputs on any
               Standard System which has sufficient resources to execute
               the program.  Only standard source programs are
               transportable.

          error condition
               An exceptional condition which requires action by the system
               which may be other than the expected function.  Refer to the
               section "10. Error Conditions".

          false
               A zero number represents the false state of a flag.

          flag
               A number that may have one of two logical states, false or
               true.  See:  "false"  "true"

          floor, arithmetic
               If z is any real number, then the floor of z is the greatest
               integer less than or equal to z.
                    The floor of +.6 is 0
                    The floor of -.4 is -1

          free field format
               Numbers are converted using the value of BASE and then
               displayed with no leading zeros.  A trailing space is
               displayed.  The number of characters displayed is the
               minimum number of characters, at least one, to uniquely
               represent the number.  See:  "number conversion"

          glossary
               A set of explanations in natural language to describe the
               corresponding computer execution of word definitions.

          immediate word
               A word which executes when encountered during compilation or
               interpretation.  Immediate words handle special cases during
               compilation.  See, for example, IF LITERAL ." etc.

          input stream
               A sequence of characters available to the system, for
               processing by the text interpreter.  The input stream
               conventionally may be taken from the current input device
               (via the text input buffer) and mass storage (via a block
               buffer).  BLK , >IN , TIB and #TIB specify the input stream.
               Words using or altering BLK , >IN , TIB and #TIB are
               responsible for maintaining and restoring control of the
               input stream.

          5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


               The input stream extends from the offset value of >IN to the
               size of the input stream.  If BLK is zero the input stream
               is contained within the area addressed by TIB and is #TIB
               bytes long.  If BLK is non-zero the input stream is
               contained within the block buffer specified by BLK and is
               1024 bytes long.   See:  "11.8 Input Text"

          interpreter, address
               The machine code instructions, routine or other facilities
               that execute compiled word definitions containing
               compilation addresses.

          interpreter, text
               The word definitions(s) that repeatedly accepts a word name
               from the input stream, locates the corresponding compilation
               address and starts the address interpreter to execute it.
               Text from the input stream interpreted as a number leaves
               the corresponding value on the data stack.  Numbers are
               accepted from the input stream unsigned or negatively signed
               and converted using the value of BASE .  See:  "number"
               "number conversion"

          layers
               The grouping of word names of each Standard word set to show
               like characteristics.  No implementation requirements are
               implied by this grouping.

          layer, compiler
               Word definitions which add new procedures to the dictionary
               or which aid compilation by adding compilation addresses or
               data structures to the dictionary.

          layer, devices
               Word definitions which allow access to mass storage and
               computer peripheral devices.

          layer, interpreter
               Word definitions which support vocabularies, terminal
               output, and the interpretation of text from the text input
               buffer or a mass storage device by executing the
               corresponding word definitions.

          layer, nucleus
               Word definitions generally defined in machine code that
               control the execution of the fundamental operations of a
               virtual FORTH machine.  This includes the address
               interpreter.

          load
               Redirection of the text interpreter's input stream to be
               from mass storage.  This is the general method for
               compilation of new definitions into the dictionary.

               Storage which might reside outside FORTH's address space.
               Mass storage data is made available in the form of 1024-byte
               blocks.  A block is accessible within the FORTH address
               space in a block buffer.  When a block has been indicated as
               UPDATEed (modified) the block will ultimately be transferred
               to mass storage.

          number
               When values exist within a larger field, the most-
               significant bits are zero.  16-bit numbers are represented
               in memory by addressing the first of two bytes at
               consecutive addresses.  The byte order is unspecified by
               this Standard.  Double numbers are represented on the stack
               with the most-significant 16 bits (with sign) most
               accessible.  Double numbers are represented in memory by two
               consecutive 16-bit numbers.  The address of the least
               significant 16 bits is two greater than the address of the
               most significant 16 bits.  The byte order within each 16-bit
               field is unspecified.  See:  "arithmetic, two's complement"
               "number types" "9.8 Numbers"  "11.7 Stack Parameters"

          number conversion
               Numbers are maintained internally in binary and represented
               externally by using graphic characters within the ASCII
               character set.  Conversion between the internal and external
               forms is performed using the current value of BASE to
               determine the digits of a number.  A digit has a value
               ranging from zero to the value of BASE-1.  The digit with
               the value zero is represented by the ASCII character "0"
               (position 3/0 with the decimal equivalent of 48).  This
               representation of digits proceeds through the ASCII
               character set to the character "(" corresponding to the
               decimal value 9.  For digits with a value exceeding 9, the
               ASCII graphic characters beginning with the character "A"
               (position 4/1 with the decimal equivalent 65) corresponding
               to the decimal value 10 are used.  This sequence then
               continues up to and including the digit with the decimal
               value 71 which is represented by the ASCII character "~"
               (position 7/14 with a decimal equivalent 126).  A negative
               number may be represented by preceding the digits with a
               single leading minus sign, the character "-".

          number types
               All number types consist of some number of bits.  These bits
               are either arbitrary or are weighted.

          5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


               Signed and unsigned numbers use weighted bits.  Weighted
               bits within a number have a value of a power of two
               beginning with the rightmost (least-significant) bit having
               the value of two to the zero power.  This weighting
               continues to the leftmost bit increasing the power by one
               for each bit.  For an unsigned number this weighting pattern
               includes the leftmost bit; thus, for an unsigned 16-bit
               number the weight of the leftmost bit is 32,768.  For a
               signed number this weighting pattern includes the leftmost
               bit but the weight of the leftmost bit is negated; thus, for
               a signed 16-bit number the weight of the leftmost bit is
               -32,768.  This weighting pattern for signed numbers is
               called two's complement notation.

               Unspecified weighted numbers are either unsigned numbers or
               signed numbers; program context determines whether the
               number is signed or unsigned.  See:  "11.7 Stack Parameters"

          pictured numeric output
               The use of numeric output definitions which convert
               numerical values into text strings.  These definitions are
               used in a sequence which resembles a symbolic 'picture' of
               the desired text format.  Conversion proceeds from least-
               significant digit to most-significant digit, and converted
               characters are stored from higher memory addresses to lower.

          program
               A complete specification of execution to achieve a specific
               function (application task) expressed in FORTH source code
               form.

          receive
               The process of obtaining one character from the current
               input device.  The selection of the current input device is
               system dependent.

          recursion
               The process of self-reference, either directly or
               indirectly.

          return
               The means of indicating the end of text by striking a key on
               an input device.  The key used is system dependent.  This
               key is typically called "RETURN", "CARRIAGE RETURN", or
               "ENTER".

          screen
               Textual data arranged for editing.  By convention, a screen
               consists of 16 lines (numbered 0 through 15) of 64
               characters each.  Screens usually contain program source
               text, but may be used to view mass storage data.  The first
               byte of a screen occupies the first byte of a mass storage
               block, which is the beginning point for text interpretation
               during a load.

          5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


          search order
               A specification of the order in which selected vocabularies
               in the dictionary are searched.  Execution of a vocabulary
               makes it the first vocabulary in the search order.  The
               dictionary is searched whenever a word is to be located by
               its name.  This order applies to all dictionary searches
               unless otherwise noted.  The search order begins with the
               last vocabulary executed and ends with FORTH , unless
               altered in a system dependent manner.

          source definition
               Text consisting of word names suitable for compilation or
               execution by the text interpreter.  Such text is usually
               arranged in screens and maintained on a mass storage device.

          stack, data
               A last in, first out list consisting of 16-bit binary
               values.  This stack is primarily used to hold intermediate
               values during execution of word definitions.  Stack values
               may represent numbers, characters, addresses, boolean
               values, etc.

               When the name 'stack' is used alone, it implies the data
               stack.

          stack, return
               A last in, first out list which contains the addresses of
               word definitions whose execution has not been completed by
               the address interpreter.  As a word definition passes
               control to another definition, the return point is placed on
               the return stack.

               The return stack may cautiously be used for other values.

          string, counted
               A sequence of consecutive 8-bit bytes located in memory by
               their low memory address.  The byte at this address contains
               a count {0..255} of the number of bytes following which are
               part of the string.  The count does not include the count
               byte itself.  Counted strings usually contain ASCII
               characters.

          string, text
               A sequence of consecutive 8-bit bytes located in memory by
               their low memory address and length in bytes.  Strings
               usually, but not exclusively, contain ASCII characters.
               When the term 'string' is used alone or in conjunction with
               other words it refers to text strings.

          structure, control

          5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


               A group of FORTH words which when executed alter the
               execution sequence.  The group starts and terminates with
               compiler words.  Examples of control structures:  DO ...
               LOOP  DO ... +LOOP  BEGIN ... WHILE ... REPEAT  BEGIN ...
               UNTIL  IF ... THEN  IF ... ELSE ... THEN  See:  "9.9 Control
               Structures"

          transportability
               This term indicates that equivalent execution results when a
               program is executed on other than the system on which it was
               created.  See:  "equivalent execution"

          true
               A non-zero value represents the true state of a flag.  Any
               non-zero value will be accepted by a standard word as
               'true'; all standard words return a 16-bit value with all
               bits set to one when returning a 'true' flag.

          user area
               An area in memory which contains the storage for user
               variable.

          variable, user
               A variable whose data storage area is usually located in the
               user area.  Some system variables are maintained in the user
               area so that the words may be re-entrant to different users.

          vocabulary
               An ordered list of word definitions.  Vocabularies are an
               advantage in separating different word definitions that may
               have the same name.  More than one definition with the same
               name can exist in one vocabulary.  The latter is called a
               redefinition.  The most recently created redefinition will
               be found when the vocabulary is searched.

          vocabulary, compilation
               The vocabulary into which new word definitions are appended.

          word
               A sequence of characters terminated by one blank or the end
               of the input stream.  Leading blanks are ignored.  Words are
               usually obtained via the input stream.

          word definition
               A named FORTH execution procedure compiled into the
               dictionary.  Its execution may be defined in terms of
               machine code, as a sequence of compilation address, or other
               compiled words.

          word name

          5.   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS


               The name of a word definition.  Word names are limited to 31
               characters and may not contain an ASCII space.  If two
               definitions have different word names in the same vocabulary
               they must be uniquely findable when this vocabulary is
               searched.  See:  "vocabulary"  "9.5.3 EXPECT"

          word set
               A named group of FORTH word definitions in the Standard.

          word set, assembler extension
               Additional words which facilitate programming in the native
               machine language of the computer which are by nature system
               dependent.

          word set, double number extension
               Additional words which facilitate manipulation of 32-bit
               numbers.

          word set, required
               The minimum words needed to compile and execute Standard
               Programs.

          word set, system extension
               Additional words which facilitate the access to internal
               system characteristics.

          word, standard
               A named FORTH procedure definition, in the Required word set
               or any extension word sets, formally reviewed and accepted
               by the Standards Team.

                            8.   COMPLIANCE AND LABELING


          The FORTH Standards Team hereby specifies the requirements for
          labeling of systems and applications so that the conditions for
          program portability may be established.

          A Standard System may use the specified labeling if it complies
          with the terms of this Standard and meets the particular Word Set
          definitions.

          A Standard Program (application) may use the specified labeling
          if it utilizes the specified Standard System according to this
          Standard and executes equivalently on any such system.

          In a system or application, a standard word may not be redefined
          to perform a different function within the vocabulary FORTH.


          FORTH Standard

          A system may be labeled:

               FORTH-83 Standard

          if it includes all of the Required Word Set in either source or
          object form and complies with the text of this Standard.  After
          executing "FORTH-83" the dictionary must contain all of the
          Required Word Set in the vocabulary FORTH, as specified in this
          Standard.


          Standard Sub-set

          A system may be labeled:

               FORTH-83 Standard Sub-set

          if it includes a portion of the Required Word Set and complies
          with the remaining text of this Standard.  However, no Required
          Word may be present with a non-standard definition.


          Standard with Extensions

          A system may be labeled:

               FORTH-83 Standard with <name> Standard Extension(s)

          if it comprises a FORTH-83 Standard System and one or more
          Standard Extension Word Set(s).  For example, a designation would
          be in the form:



                                         16





          8.   COMPLIANCE AND LABELING


               FORTH-83 Standard with Double-Number Standard Extension


          Standard Program

          A FORTH source program which executes equivalently on any
          Standard System may be labeled:

               FORTH-83 Standard Program

          See:  "equivalent execution"  "7. REQUIREMENTS"


          Standard Program with Environmental Dependencies

          A program which is standard in all ways except for specific
          environmentally dependent words may be labeled:

               FORTH-83 Standard Program with Environmental Dependencies

          if the following additional requirements are met:

               1) Environmental dependencies (including hardware
               dependencies) shall be factored into an isolated set of
               application word definitions.

               2) Each environmentally dependent word definition must be
               fully documented, including all dependencies in a manner at
               least as detailed as the standard words.

          9.   USAGE




                                     9.   USAGE



          9.1  Words Names and Word Definitions

          A Standard Program may reference only the definitions of the
          Required Word Set and Standard Extensions and definitions which
          are subsequently defined in terms of these words.  Furthermore, A
          Standard Program must use the standard words as required by any
          conventions of this Standard.  Equivalent execution must result
          from Standard Programs.

          The implementation of a Standard System may use words and
          techniques outside the scope of the Standard, provided that no
          program running on that system is required to use words outside
          the Standard for normal operation.

          If a Standard System or Standard Program redefines Standard
          definitions within the FORTH vocabulary, these definitions must
          comply with the Standard.


          9.2  Addressable Memory

          The FORTH system may share the dictionary space with the user's
          application.  The native addressing protocol of the host computer
          is beyond the scope of this Standard.

          Therefore, in a Standard Program, the user may only operate on
          data which was stored by the application.  No exceptions!

          A Standard Program may address:

          1.   parameter fields of words created with CREATE , VARIABLE ,
               and user defined words which execute CREATE ;

          2.   dictionary space ALLOTted;

          3.   data in a valid mass storage block buffer.   
               See:  "9.7 Multiprogramming Impact";

          4.   data area of user variables;

          5.   text input buffer and PAD up to the amount specified as the
               minimum for each area.

          A Standard Program may NOT address:

          1.   directly into the data or return stacks;

          2.   into a definition's name field, link field, or code field;



                                         18





          9.   USAGE


          3.   into a definition's parameter field if not stored by the
               application.


          9.3  Return Stack

          A Standard Program may cautiously use the return stack with the
          following restrictions:

          The return stack may not be accessed inside a do-loop for values
          placed on the return stack before the loop was entered.  Further,
          neither I nor J may be used to obtain the index of a loop if
          values are placed and remain on the return stack within the loop.
          When the do-loop is executed all values placed on the return
          stack within that loop must be removed before LOOP , +LOOP , or
          LEAVE is executed.  Similarly, all values placed on the return
          stack within a colon definition must be removed before the colon
          definition is terminated at ; or before EXIT is executed.


          9.4  Compilation

          The system uses the return stack and the dictionary in a system
          dependent manner during the compilation of colon definitions.
          Some words use the data stack in a system dependent manner during
          compilation.  See:  "sys (11.7)"


          9.5  Terminal Input and Output


          9.5.1     KEY

          A Standard System must receive all valid ASCII characters.  Each
          KEY receives one ASCII character, with more-significant bits
          environmentally dependent and might be zero.  KEY must receive as
          many bits as are obtainable.  A Standard Program without
          environmental dependencies may only use the least significant 7-
          bit ASCII character received by KEY .  For example:  KEY 127 AND


          9.5.2     EXPECT

          Control characters may be processed to allow system dependent
          editing of the characters prior to receipt.  Therefore, a
          Standard Program may not anticipated that control characters can
          be received.










                                         19





          9.   USAGE


          9.5.3     EMIT

          Because of the potential non-transportable action by terminal
          devices of control characters, the use of ASCII control
          characters is an environmental dependency.  Each EMIT deals with
          only one ASCII character.  The ASCII character occupies the
          least-significant 7 bits; the more-significant bits may be
          environmentally dependent.  Using the more-significant bits when
          other than zero is an environmentally dependent usage.  EMIT must
          display as many bits as can be sent.


          9.5.4     TYPE

          Because of the potential non-transportable action by terminal
          devices of control characters, the use of ASCII control
          characters is an environmental dependency.


          9.6  Transporting Programs Between Standard Systems

          Further usage requirements are expected to be added for
          transporting programs between Standard Systems.


          9.7  Multiprogramming Impact

          In a multiprogrammed system, Device Layer words and those words
          which implicitly reference the Device Layer words may relinquish
          control of the processor to other tasks.  Although there is
          insufficient experience to specify a standard for
          multiprogramming, historical usage dictates that a programmer be
          aware of the potential impact with regard to resources shared
          between tasks.  The only shared resources specified within the
          Standard are block buffers.  Therefore the address of a block
          buffer returned by BLOCK or BUFFER becomes invalid during and
          after the execution of any word marked by the attribute M in the
          glossary or any words executing them.  A block buffer is valid
          only if its address is valid.  See:  "11.4 Attributes"


          9.8  Numbers

          Interpreted or compiled numbers are in the range
          {-32,768..65,535}.  See:  "number conversion"


          9.9  Control Structures

          Control structures are compiled inside colon definitions.
          Control structures can be nested but cannot overlap.  For
          additional limitations see DO .

          10.1 Possible Actions on an Error

          When an error condition occurs, a Standard System may take one or
          more of the following actions:

          1.   ignore and continue;

          2.   display a message;

          3.   execute a particular word;

          4.   set interpret state and interpret a block;

          5.   set interpret state and begin interpretation;

          6.   other system dependent actions.

          See:  "7.1 Documentation Requirements"


          10.2 General Error Conditions

          The following error conditions apply in many situations.  These
          error conditions are listed below, but may occur at various times
          and with various words.

          1.   input stream exhausted before encountering a required <name>                                                                      ____ 
               or delimiting character;

          2.   insufficient stack space or insufficient number of stack
               entries during text interpretation or compilation;

          3.   a word not found and not a valid number, during text
               interpretation or compilation;

          4.   compilation of incorrectly nested control structures;

          5.   execution of words restricted to compilation only, when not
               in the compile state and while not compiling a colon
               definition;

          6.   FORGETting within the system to a point that removes a word
               required for correct execution;

          7.   insufficient space remaining in the dictionary;

          8.   a stack parameter out of range, e.g., a negative number when
               a +n was specified in the glossary;

          11.1 Order

          The glossary definitions are listed in ASCII alphabetical order.


          11.2 Capitalization

          Word names are capitalized throughout this Standard.


          11.3 Stack Notation

          The stack parameters input to and output from a definition are
          described using the notation:

               before -- after

                    before    stack parameters before execution
                    after     stack parameters after execution

          In this notation, the top of the stack is to the right.  Words
          may also be shown in context when appropriate.

          Unless otherwise noted, all stack notation describes exectution
          time.  If it applies at compile time, the line is followed by:
          (compiling) .


          11.4 Attributes

          Capitalized symbols indicate attributes of the defined words:

          C    The word may only be used during compilation of a colon
               definition.

          I    Indicates that the word is IMMEDIATE and will execute during
               compilation, unless special action is taken.

          M    This word has a potential multiprogramming impact.     
               See:  "9.7 Multiprogramming Impact"

          U    A user variable.

          11.5 Serial Numbers

          When a substantive alteration to a word's definition is made or
          when a new word is added, the serial number will be the last two
          digits of the year of the Standard in which such change was made
          (i.e., "83").  When such change is made within a Working Draft,
          the number will be suffixed with the character identifying the
          draft (i.e., "83A").


          11.6 Pronunciation

          The natural language pronunciation of word names is given in
          double quotes (") where it differs from English pronunciation.


          11.7 Stack Parameters

          Unless otherwise stated, all references to numbers apply to 16-
          bit signed integers.  The implied range of values is shown as
          {from..to}.  The contents of an address is shown by double
          braces, particularly for the contents of variables, i.e., BASE
          {{2..72}}.

          The following are the stack parameter abbreviations and types of
          numbers used throughout the glossary.  These abbreviations may be
          suffixed with a digit to differentiate multiple parameters of the
          same type.

          Because of the use of two's complement arithmetic, the signed 16-
          bit number (n) -1 has the same bit representation as the unsigned
          number (u) 65,535.  Both of these numbers are within the set of
          unspecified weighted numbers (w).  See:  "arithmetic, two's

               The remainder of +d1 divided by the value of BASE is
               converted to an ASCII character and appended to the output
               string toward lower memory addresses.  +d2 is the quotient
               and is maintained for further processing.  Typically used
               between <# and #> .

               +d is converted appending each resultant character into the
               pictured numeric output string until the quotient (see: # )
               is zero.  A single zero is added to the output string if the
               number was initially zero.  Typically used between <# and
               #> .

               n1 is first multiplied by n2 producing an intermediate 32-
               bit result.  n4 is the floor of the quotient of the
               intermediate 32-bit result divided by the divisor n3.  The
               product of n1 times n2 is maintained as an intermediate 32-
               bit result for greater precision than the otherwise
               equivalent sequence: n1 n2 * n3 / .  An error condition

               Used at the destination of a backward branch.  addr is
               typically only used by <RESOLVE to compile a branch address.

          <RESOLVE     addr --                       C,83"backward-resolve"
               Used at the source of a backward branch after either BRANCH

               destination address.

          >MARK        -- addr                       C,83   "forward-mark"
               Used at the source of a forward branch.  Typically used
               after either BRANCH or ?BRANCH .  Compiles space in the
               dictionary for a branch address which will later be resolved
               by >RESOLVE .

          >RESOLVE     addr --                       C,83"forward-resolve"
               Used at the destination of a forward branch.  Calculates the
               branch address (to the current location in the dictionary)
               using addr and places this branch address into the space
               left by >MARK .

          ?BRANCH      flag --                       C,83"question-branch"
               When used in the form:  COMPILE ?BRANCH  a conditional
               branch operation is compiled.  See BRANCH for further
               details.  When executed, if flag is false the branch is
               performed as with BRANCH .  When flag is true execution
               continues at the compilation address immediately following
               the branch address.

               When used in the form:  COMPILE BRANCH  an unconditional
               branch operation is compiled.  A branch address must be
               compiled immediately following this compilation address.
               The branch address is typically generated by following
               BRANCH with <RESOLVE or >MARK .

          The Controlled Reference Words are word definitions which,
          although not required, cannot be present with a non-standard
          definition in the vocabulary FORTH of a Standard System.  These
          words have present usage and/or are candidates for future
          standardization.

               n is converted using BASE and then displayed right aligned
               in a field +n characters wide.  A leading minus sign is
               displayed if n is negative.  If the number of characters
               required to display n is greater than +n, an error condition
               exists.  See:  "number conversion"

          2*           w1 -- w2                      83        "two-times"

          The Uncontrolled Reference Word Set contains glossary definitions
          which are included for public reference of words that have past
          or present usage and/or are candidates for future
          standardization.  No recommendation is made that these words be
          included in a system.

          No restrictions are placed on the definition or usage of
          uncontrolled words.  However, use of these names for procedures
          differing from the given definitions is discouraged.

               Compare two strings over the length +n1 beginning at addr1
               and addr2.  Return zero if the strings are equal.  If
               unequal, return n2, the difference between the last
               characters compared:  addr1(i) - addr2(i).

          Since FORTH is an extensible language and subject to evolution,
          the Standard contains a section describing experimental
          proposals.  FORTH users are encouraged to study, implement, and
          try these proposals to aid in the analysis of and the decision
          for or against future adoption into the Standard.  Readers are
          cautioned that these proposals contain opinions and conclusions
          of the authors of the proposals and that these proposals may
          contain non-standard source code.

          1  INTRODUCTION

               The method of selecting the order in which the dictionary is
          searched has grown from unchained vocabularies to the present use
          of chained vocabularies.  Many techniques are in use for
          specification of the sequence in which multiple vocabularies may
          be searched.  In order to offer generality and yet get precision
          in specification, this proposal is offered.


          2  DESCRIPTION

          The following functions are required:

          1.   Two search orders exist.  CONTEXT is the group of
               vocabularies searched during interpretation of text from the
               input stream.  CURRENT is the single vocabulary into which
               new definitions are compiled, and from which FORGET
               operates.

          2.   Empty CONTEXT to a minimum number of system words.  These
               are just the words to further specify the search order.

          3.   Add individual vocabularies into CONTEXT.  The most recently
               added is searched first.

          4.   Specify which single vocabulary will become CURRENT.

               The following optional functions aid the user:

          1.   Display the word names of the first vocabulary in the
               CONTEXT search order.

          2.   Display the vocabulary names comprising CURRENT and CONTEXT
               search orders.












                                         66





          C.  EXPERIMENTAL PROPOSALS


          3  ADVANTAGES

               Use over the past year has demonstrated that the proposed
          methods may emulate the vocabulary selection of all other
          systems.  The order is explicit by execution, may be interpreted
          and compiled, and is obvious from the declaration.  The search
          order is specified at run-time rather than the time a new
          vocabulary is created.


          4  DISADVANTAGES

               By migrating to a common structure, vendors give up one
          point at which they may claim their product is better than
          others.  Another drawback is that the number of CONTEXT
          vocabularies is fixed; older methods had an indefinite 'tree'
          structure.  In practice, the branching of such a structure was
          very rarely greater than four.

               Forth words operate in a context sensitive environment, as
          word names may be redefined and have different definitions in
          different vocabularies.  This proposal compounds the problem.  By
          displaying the search order names, the user at least can readily
          verify the search order.


          5  IMPACT

               The text of the Forth 83 Standard has been carefully chosen
          for consistency and generality.  However, no specification on how
          the search order is developed by the user is given.  This
          omission is unavoidable, due to the diversity of contemporary
          practice.  This proposal is intended to complete the Forth 83
          requirements in a fashion that exceeds all other methods.

               Previously standardized words continue in their use:
          VOCABULARY, FORTH, DEFINITIONS, and FORGET.  However, this
          proposal assumes that vocabulary names are not IMMEDIATE .


          6  DEFINITIONS

          Search order:  
               The sequence in which vocabularies are selected when
               locating a word by name in the dictionary.  Consists of one
               transient and up to three resident vocabularies.

          Transient order:    
               Execution of any vocabulary makes it the first vocabulary
               searched, replacing the previously selected transient
               vocabulary.

          C.  EXPERIMENTAL PROPOSALS


          Resident order:     
               After searching the transient order, up to three additional
               vocabularies may be searched.  The application program
               controls this selection.


          7  GLOSSARY

          ONLY         --                            ONLY
               Select just the ONLY vocabulary as both the transient
               vocabulary and resident vocabulary in the search order.

          FORTH        --                            ONLY                 
               The name of the primary vocabulary.  Execution makes FORTH
               the transient vocabulary, the first in the search order, and
               thus replaces the previous transient vocabulary.

          ALSO         --                            ONLY                 
               The transient vocabulary becomes the first vocabulary in the
               resident portion of the search order.  Up to the last two
               resident vocabularies will also be reserved, in order,
               forming the resident search order.

          ORDER        --                            ONLY                 
               Display the vocabulary names forming the search order in
               their present search order sequence.  Then show the
               vocabulary into which new definitions will be placed.

          WORDS        --                            ONLY                 
               Display the word names in the transient vocabulary, starting
               with the most recent definition.

          FORGET       --                            ONLY                 
               Used in the form:                     
                       FORGET <name>                                                ____                  
               Delete from the dictionary <name> and all words added to the                                           ____                            
               dictionary after <name> regardless of the vocabulary.                                 ____                               
               Failure to find <name> is an error condition.  An error                                ____                                  
               condition also exists upon implicitly forgetting a
               vocabulary (due to its definition after <name>).                                                        ____   

          DEFINITIONS  --                            ONLY                 
               Select the transient vocabulary as the current vocabulary
               into which subsequent definitions will be added.

          SEAL         --                            ONLY                 
               Delete all occurances of ONLY from the search order.  The
               effect is that only specified application vocabularies will
               be searched.

                                    Kim R. Harris


          A.  INTRODUCTION

          The standard provides a transportable way to obtain the
          compilation address of a definition in the dictionary of a FORTH
          system (cf., FIND and ' ).  It also provides an operator to
          convert a compilation address to its corresponding parameter
          field address.  However, the standard does not provide a
          transportable way to convert either of these addresses to the
          other fields of a definition.  Since various FORTH
          implementations have different dictionary structures, a standard
          set of conversion operators would increase transportability and
          readability.

          A set of words is proposed which allows the conversion of any
          definitions field address to any other.


          B.  GLOSSARY

          In the following words, the compilation address is either the
          source or the destination, so it is not indicated in the names.

          >BODY        addr1 -- addr2                            "to-body"
               addr2 is the parameter field address corresponding to the
               compilation address addr1.

          >NAME        addr1 -- addr2                            "to-name"
               addr2 is the name field address corresponding to the
               compilation address addr1.

          >LINK        addr1 -- addr2                            "to-link"
               addr2 is the link field address corresponding to the
               compilation address addr1.

          BODY>        addr1 -- addr2                          "from-body"
               addr2 is the compilation address corresponding to the
               parameter field address addr1.

          NAME>        addr1 -- addr2                          "from-name"
               addr2 is the compilation address corresponding to the name
               field address addr1.




                                         71





          C.  EXPERIMENTAL PROPOSALS


          LINK>        addr1 -- addr2                          "from-link"
               addr2 is the compilation address corresponding to the link
               field address addr1.

          The previous set of words is complete, but may be inefficient for
          going between two fields when one is not the compilation address.
          For greater efficiency, additional operators may be defined which
          name both the source and destination fields.

          N>LINK       addr1 -- addr2                       "name-to-link"
               addr2 is the link field address corresponding to the name
               field address addr1.

          L>NAME       addr1 -- addr2                       "link-to-name"
               addr2 is the name field address corresponding to the link
               field address addr1.


          C.  DISCUSSION

          The previous words provide a complete, consistent, and efficient
          set of definition field address conversion operations.  They can
          be implemented in a FORTH system which uses any combination of
          the following options for its dictionary structure:

               Link fields first or second.
               Fixed or variable length name fields.
               Additional fields in the definitions structure.

               Heads contiguous or separated from bodies.

               Indirect, direct, subroutine, or token threaded code.

          The words are compatible with this standard; their inclusion
          would not require other changes to be made to the standard.

          Disadvantages to including them in the standard include:

               They add 6 to 8 more words to the standard.

               A standard program may not use all of them since it is not
               allowed to access the name or link fields.  However, this
               does not disqualify them from being in the standard.

               If a definition's head is not in the dictionary, an error
               condition would exist.  In this case, what action should the
               words take in an implemented system?

          The author of this experimental proposal recommends that FORTH
          system implementors try them and that they be included in the
          System Word Set of the next FORTH standard.

          D.  SOURCE CODE EXAMPLE

          High level source code is shown below for a very simple
          dictionary structure.  This code assumes a FORTH system which
          uses indirect threaded code, heads contiguous to bodies, and a
          definition structure of the following format:

               Name field, 4 bytes long, fixed length.
               Link field, 2 bytes long.
               Code field, 2 bytes long.
               Parameter field, variable length.

          : >BODY   ( acf -- apf )  2+  ;
          : BODY>   ( apf -- acf )  2-  ;
          : >LINK   ( acf -- alf )  2-  ;
          : LINK>   ( alf -- acf )  2-  ;
          : >NAME   ( acf -- anf )  6 - ;
          : NAME>   ( anf -- alf )  6 + ;
          : N>LINK  ( anf -- alf )  4 + ;
          : L>NAME  ( alf -- anf )  4 - ;

                                FORTH STANDARDS TEAM



          1.  Purpose and Goals


          1.1  Purpose

               1.1.1  This Charter establishes and guides a voluntary
               membership professional organization, the FORTH Standards
               Team (hereafter referred to as the "FST") and provides a
               method for its operation.


          1.2  Goals

               1.2.1  The goal of the FST is the creation, maintenance, and
               proliferation of a standard (hereafter referred to as the
               "Standard") for the FORTH computer programming system and
               for application programs executed by a Standard system.  The
               Standard shall specify requirements and constraints which
               such computer software must satisfy.

               1.2.2  The team shall also develop a method of
               identification and labeling of FORTH implementations and
               programs which conform to the Standard.


          1.3  Organization

               1.3.1  The FST is a voluntary membership organization with
               no formal status as a legal entity.  It operates by
               consensus of the professional and commercial FORTH community
               and conducts business by the professional discourse and
               agreement of its members.  It is intended that this Charter
               be a guide to the operation of the FST subject to reasonable
               minor digression, rather than being a rigid document under
               which vested rights are granted.

          D.  CHARTER


          2.  METHODS


          2.1  Formal Meetings

               2.1.1  The FST shall hold periodic formal meetings for
               discussion and decisions concerning a current or future
               Standard.

               2.1.2  There is not specified frequency for formal meetings.
               Each meeting shall be at such time and place as was decided
               at the prior meeting.  If a meeting cannot be held as
               decided, the Chairperson may designate another time and
               place.

               2.1.3  The Chairperson shall send a written notice at least
               sixty (60) days in advance of each formal meeting to each
               voting member.  A longer notification period is recommended.
               It is anticipated that the continuing close coordination of
               the participants, the decision at the prior formal meeting,
               and publication of a meeting notice in FORTH Dimensions and                                                      ________________    
               other trade journals will provide sufficient notice to the
               FORTH community.

               2.1.4  At a formal FST meeting, there shall be general
               sessions consisting of all attendees.  General sessions are
               for matters that are ready for discussion and decision.  All
               votes concerning the Standard, Charter, or FST procedures
               must take place during a general session.

               2.1.5  Also at formal meetings, subteams will be established
               to examine groups of proposals and to prepare
               recommendations for a general session.  All meeting
               attendees may participate in the work and voting of a
               subteam.  Each subteam should elect from its members a
               coordinator to conduct its meetings and a reporter to record
               and report its recommendations.

               2.1.6  The Chairperson may publish and distribute an agenda
               at or in advance of a formal meeting.  As a guideline, each
               day of a formal meeting begins with a general session,
               followed by concurrent subteam meetings followed by another
               general session.

               2.1.7  In view of the voluntary nature of the FST, at least
               one third of the membership is required to hold a formal
               meeting.  Two thirds of the number of voting members present
               at the start of each day's first general session shall set
               the quorum for the remainder of that day.

          D.  CHARTER


               2.1.8  Between formal meetings, the Chairperson may appoint
               such informal working groups as is appropriate.  Each group
               may be given a goal and scope to direct its activities.  Its
               conclusions or recommendations must be given to the
               Chairperson in written form.


          2.2  Proposals and Comments

               2.2.1  Prior to each formal meeting, the Chairperson may
               solicit submission of comments and proposals for changes,
               additions, or deletions to the then-current Standard, the
               draft Standard or this Charter.  A cutoff date may be
               specified for the submission of such proposals.

               2.2.2  A considerable amount of information must accompany
               each proposal to help FST members analyze the proposal.
               Therefore, submission of proposals and comments shall be
               according to the format and instructions shown in the
               "Proposal/Comment Form" included as an Appendix to this
               Standard.  Any proposal not in the appropriate form or
               received after the cutoff date may not be considered unless
               the Chairperson deems it to be of sufficient significance.

               2.2.3  Unsolicited proposals and comments by volunteers are
               acknowledged as valuable.  Any individual or group may
               submit proposals and/or comments concerning the Standard or
               this Charter.  These should be sent to the official address
               of the FST.  Properly formatted proposals and comments are
               preferred.  The author or a representative should plan to
               attend the next formal meeting to emphasize, support, and
               possibly modify the proposals.

               2.2.4  Since the quantity of proposals and comments may
               exceed the number for which there is time to be voted upon,
               submission of a proposal does not automatically mean that it
               will be voted upon at the next formal FST meeting.  The
               Chairperson or some members appointed by the Chairperson or
               elected by the voting members may screen and organize the
               received proposals and comments for voting upon at the next
               formal meeting.

               2.2.5  To allow reflection and examination, proposals and
               comments shall be distributed to FST voting members and
               sponsors in advance of a formal meeting.  Proposals and
               comments not distributed in advance, including proposals
               made during a formal meeting, may be considered at the
               discretion of the Chairperson.

          2.3  Draft Standard

               After a formal meeting, the referees and officers of the FST
               shall prepare a draft Standard for review by the then-
               current FST voting members.  The referees and officers shall
               consolidate proposals accepted by vote during the meeting,
               resolve any ambiguities or problems, and incorporate these
               changes with the text of the previous Standard or draft
               Standard.


          2.4  Standard

               2.4.1  The referees and officers may, by near unanimous
               decision (not more than one no vote), declare the draft
               Standard, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, as being
               the proposed Standard.

               2.4.2  A proposed Standard shall be distributed to all FST
               voting members for a mail ballot.  This ballot shall be
               based solely on the text of the proposed Standard as
               distributed.

               2.4.3  Each ballot returned shall be signed by the voting
               member submitting it.  An affirmative vote of at least two
               thirds of the voting members shall adopt the document.  Such
               adoption makes the draft Standard the current, official FST
               Standard which supersedes all prior Standards.


          2.5  Charter

               2.5.1  At a formal FST meeting, the charter may be amended
               by a simple majority of voting members present provided that
               at least one third of all voting members are present; such
               amendments become effective at the end of the current formal
               meeting.

               2.5.2  At other than a formal FST meeting, the charter may
               be amended by a simple majority of all voting members, such
               vote to be taken by signed mail ballots.

          3.  MEMBERSHIP


          3.1  General

               Membership in the FST is a privilege, not a right.  An
               invitation for voting membership may be extended to those
               who the FST feels can contribute to the goals of the
               Standard and the FST.  There are several classes of
               participation in the efforts of the FST.  Membership in each
               class has no specified term but continues from the time when
               membership is initiated to the conclusion of the next formal
               meeting.


          3.2  Voting Members

               3.2.1  Voting members are individuals who are elected into
               such membership at the concluding session of a formal FST
               meeting.  Any voting member who resigns between formal
               meetings shall not be replaced until the membership
               elections at the conclusion of the next formal meeting.  A
               newly elected voting member gains voting rights only after
               all voting members have been elected.  A significant
               professional FORTH background is required of voting members.

               3.2.2  Each voting member present at a formal meeting shall
               indicate in writing his or her desire to continue as a
               voting member.  Only these voting members can vote in a
               general session of a formal meeting on any matters affecting
               the Standard or the Charter and on the election of all
               voting members.

               3.2.3  Voting members are elected by a simple majority of
               those voting members present.  The number of voting members
               shall be limited to thirty (30).  Individuals eligible to be
               elected are selected from each of the following ordered
               categories in order, until the number of voting members
               reaches the limit.

                    3.2.3.1  Category 1:  current voting member who have
                    actively participated in at least two days of a formal
                    meeting.  Voting members are expected to actively
                    participate in subteam meetings and all general
                    sessions.

                    3.2.3.2  Category 2:  current voting members who are
                    not eligible by Category 1, but who have requested in
                    writing that his or her voting membership be
                    maintained.

                    3.2.3.3  Category 3:  eligible candidates.  Eligible
                    candidates will be presented to the voting members then
                    elected as follows:

          D.  CHARTER


                         3.2.3.3.1  If the number of eligible candidates
                         does not exceed the number of openings for voting
                         membership, each candidate is voted upon and
                         accepted by a simple majority.

                         3.2.3.3.2  If the number of eligible candidates
                         does exceed the number of openings for voting
                         membership, candidates will be voted upon by
                         ballot whereby each voting member may vote for up
                         to the number of openings remaining.  Those
                         candidates receiving the most votes will be
                         elected until there are no more openings for
                         voting membership.


          3.3  Candidates

               3.3.1  Candidates are individuals who desire to actively
               participate in and support the FST by becoming voting
               members.

               3.3.2  To be eligible, each Candidate must:  declare in
               writing to the secretary at the first general session of a
               formal FST meeting that he or she is a Candidate, actively
               participate in subteam meetings and all general sessions at
               a formal FST meeting, and have a significant professional
               background in FORTH.  The Chairperson may request
               information or ask questions of any candidate to determine
               his or her technical knowledge and experience.  Candidates
               are expected to submit proposals, participate in the
               discussions of the formal meeting, and contribute to the
               work and voting of subteams.


          3.4  Observers

               3.4.1  Observers are individuals who attend a formal meeting
               but are neither voting members nor candidates.  At the
               discretion of the Chairperson, they may contribute to the
               discussion at general sessions and to the work of subteams.
               The number of observers allowed at a formal meeting may be
               limited by the Chairperson.


          3.5  FST Sponsors

               3.5.1  FST sponsors are individuals or organizations who
               contribute funds and other assistance to aid the work of the
               FST.  FST sponsors have no duties or responsibilities in the
               FST, but they will receive copies of proposals and comments
               considered at a formal meeting, and drafts and adopted
               standards prepared as a result of that meeting.

          D.  CHARTER


               3.5.3  FST sponsorship exists from the end of one formal
               meeting to the end of the next formal meeting.

               3.5.3  Qualification of FST sponsors may be determined by a
               simple majority vote at a formal FST meeting.  If no such
               qualification exist, the Chairperson may specify
               qualifications, including the amount of financial
               contributions, which will remain in effect until the next
               formal FST meeting.


          4.  OFFICERS


          4.1  General

               There shall be four types of elected officers of the FST:
               the Chairperson, the Secretary, the Treasurer, and one or
               more Referees.  Each officer shall be elected at a formal
               meeting of the FST and serve until the next formal meeting.


          4.2  Vacancies

               If any office other than the Chairperson becomes vacant
               between formal meetings, the Chairperson may appoint a
               replacement.  If the office of the Chairperson becomes
               vacant between formal meetings, a new Chairperson shall be
               elected by an informal majority vote of the remaining
               officers.  At any formal meeting, any officer, including the
               Chairperson, may be replaced by a simple majority vote of
               the voting members present at that meeting.


          4.3  Chairperson

               4.3.1  The Chairperson is responsible for governing the
               general business of the FST.  He or she is responsible for
               implementing the FST's Charter and any other requirements
               specified by the Standard.

               4.3.2  The Chairperson's term of office shall be from the
               conclusion of the formal meeting at which he or she is
               elected to the conclusion of the next formal meeting.  The
               election of a Chairperson is held at the concluding general
               session of a formal meeting after the election of voting
               members; hence, newly elected voting members may vote for
               the Chairperson.  Only voting members are eligible to be
               elected Chairperson.

               4.3.3  The Chairperson shall conduct each formal meeting.
               In general, the meetings will follow the current Robert's                                                                ________
               Rules of Order; however, the Chairperson may determine the               ______________                                            
               specific rules for a formal meeting.

          D.  CHARTER


               4.3.4  Any matter needing a decision between formal meetings
               not specified by this Charter shall be decided by the
               Chairperson.

               4.3.5  The Chairperson has duties and responsibilities
               specified elsewhere in this Charter.


          4.4  Secretary

               4.4.1  The Secretary is responsible for recording the
               activities and results of the FST.

               4.4.2  The Secretary is elected at the first general session
               of a formal meeting and serves until a Secretary is elected
               at the beginning of the next formal meeting.

               4.4.3  The Secretary has many responsibilities.

               4.4.3.1  The Secretary is responsible for collecting,
               maintaining, and archiving the official copies of the
               Standard, the Charter, all other FST documents,
               correspondence, and lists of the FST members of each class.

               4.4.3.2  During a formal meeting, the Secretary is
               responsible for:

                    (a)  Keeping the minutes of the general sessions,
                    including all votes taken.  For votes affecting the
                    Standard or Charter, he or she shall:  record the
                    number of voting members present, determine if a quorum
                    is present, determine the number of affirmative votes
                    required for the vote to pass, the number of voting
                    members voting in the affirmative and negative, and the
                    result of the vote.

                    (b)  Recording and verifying the attendance and
                    membership class of each attendee.

                    (c)  Recording the recommendations of subteams.

               4.4.3.3  The Secretary is also responsible for collecting,
               archiving, and distributing proposals before a formal
               meeting.  He or she is also responsible for incorporating
               proposals accepted during a formal meeting into the Standard
               or Charter.  Other officers aid the Secretary in these
               duties.

          4.5  Treasurer

               4.5.1  The Treasurer is responsible for managing the
               financial business of the FST.  He or she is responsible for
               maintaining accurate and current financial records and for
               accepting and dispersing funds for official FST activities.



                                         81





          D.  CHARTER


               4.5.2  The Treasurer's term of office shall be from the
               conclusion of the formal meeting at which he or she is
               elected to the conclusion of the next formal meeting.  The
               election of a Treasurer is held just after the election of
               the Chairperson.  Only voting members are eligible to be
               elected Treasurer.


          4.6  Referees

               4.6.1  At the conclusion of a formal meeting there may be
               additional technical work required to prepare a draft
               Standard or Charter.  This work shall be performed by the
               officers of the FST, including a group of Referees.  They
               should be individuals who have superior knowledge and
               experience in the implementation and use of FORTH.

               4.6.2  At least three and no more than five Referees shall
               be elected by a majority of the voting members present at
               the concluding general sessions of a formal meeting.  This
               takes place after the election of voting members.  A
               Referee's term is from election at the end of one formal
               meeting until the end of the next formal meeting.  Only
               voting members are eligible to be elected as Referees.

               4.6.3  The Referees shall adopt methods and rules as they
               deem appropriate to complete their work; they may be
               informal.  However, any matter committed to the Referees for
               resolution must achieve near unanimous agreement (not more
               than one no vote).  Lacking that, the matter shall be
               omitted from further action pending further consideration at
               the next formal meeting.


          5.  EXPERIMENTAL PROPOSALS


          5.1  General

               5.1.1  Since FORTH is an extensible language and subject to
               evolution, the Standard may contain a section describing
               experimental proposal to aid in the analysis of and the
               decision for or against future adoption into the Standard.
               After the results of experimentation are known, each
               proposal will be considered, at a future formal meeting, for
               inclusion into the Standard.

               5.1.2  An experimental proposal may be individual FORTH
               words, sets of related words, or specifications for part of
               the Standard.  Experimental proposals may be derived from
               ordinary proposals or other contributions.






                                         82





          D.  CHARTER


          5.2  Required Information

               Each experimental proposal must contain the following
               minimum information:

               5.2.1  A description of the proposal including an overview
               of its functions and its interactions with existing FORTH
               words.

               5.2.2  A glossary entry of each word in the form and
               notation of the Standard.

               5.2.3  A statement by the author(s) indicating why the
               proposal meets inclusion into the Standard.  Both advantages
               and disadvantages should be discussed.


          5.3  Suggested Information

               It is suggested that each experimental proposal also
               include:

               5.3.1  A source definition for each word in the proposal.
               High level definitions using Standard words are preferred,
               but new primitive words may be defined in an assembly
               language of one commonly-known processor.  Sufficient
               documentation should be provided so that implementation on
               other processors is direct.

               5.3.2  An example showing usage of the new words.


          6.  VOTING


          6.1  General

               Only voting members have the right to vote on proposals
               affecting the Standard, a draft Standard, or this Charter.


          6.2  Advisory Votes

               At the discretion of the Chairperson, advisory votes may be
               requested at a formal meeting.  At the discretion of the
               Chairperson, all attendees may participate in an advisory
               vote.


          6.3  Method

               Any vote at a formal meeting may be by show of hands or, at
               the discretion of the Chairperson, by an informal secret
               paper ballot or a roll call.



                                         83





          D.  CHARTER


          6.4  Number

               A vote to adopt a proposal into the draft Standard or to
               change the Standard, except for the Experimental Proposals
               section of the Standard requires a two-thirds affirmative
               vote of the voting members present at a general session of a
               formal meeting, provided that the number of votes cast are
               at least two thirds of that morning's quorum count.  To
               adopt an experimental proposal into the Experimental
               Proposals section of the draft Standard or to change this
               Charter, an affirmative vote of a simple majority is
               required.  Accepting any other procedural matter at a formal
               meeting requires only a simple majority affirmative vote.


          6.5  Proxies

               All votes must be cast by the particular voting member
               eligible to vote.  No proxy voting is allowed.

                         APPENDIX E.  PROPOSAL/COMMENT FORM


          The following pages are the proposal and/or comment submittal
          form.  The form includes instructions which should be
          explanatory.  Copies of submitted proposals and comments will be
          made available to FORTH Standards Team members and to team
          sponsors.

                  Proposal and Comment Submittal Form Instructions

          Please use the supplied forms for your entire proposal.  The
          continuation form is only to be used if absolutely necessary; try
          to get your proposal to fit on the first sheet.  If it helps, use
          a reducing copy machine to get more material onto the first
          sheet.  If you must use multiple sheets, put the main idea onto
          the first sheet and less important material onto continuation
          sheets.  Remember that material on continuation sheets may be
          overlooked.

          The proposal forms have been produced on a computer system so
          that you may produce your proposals using your own computer
          system.  If you print your proposal and form on your computer
          system, all of the information shown on the form(s) MUST be
          printed and in the same location.

          The following are the instructions for each of the areas of the
          form:

          1.   Please think of the most appropriate keyword or keywords
               describing your proposal.

          2.   Select the best of the following categories of proposals:
