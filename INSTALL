To build, type "make".  This will first build the bootstrap Forth by
metacompiling the kernel for the C target, and then call gcc to
generate an executable which runs under Linux, MacOS X, or Cygwin.

The bootstrap metacompiler is written in Lisp.  An attempt is made to
automatically detect an implementation, but if that fails you will
have to provide some assistance.  Currently, CLISP, Clozure CL, ECL,
and SBCL are supported.

After the bootstrap Forth has been built, it will build the target
Forth using the Forth metacompiler.  Subsequent builds will skip the
bootstrap stage.

By default, the C target will be built.  To build another target,
define TARGET on the make command line.  Some targets also support
different operating system hosts, which is specified with the OS make
variable.  For example:

    make TARGET=x86 OS=linux
