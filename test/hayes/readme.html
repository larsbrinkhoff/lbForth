            Introduction
          </h2>
          <p>
            Checking that an ANS Forth system is compliant with the ANS Forth
            standard requires a set of test programs. This download provides
            some test programs that go some way towards meeting this
            requirement. The tests are based on the widely known tester
            developed by John Hayes and include his original core tests. The
            tests provided in the download are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Core words (by John Hayes) plus some additional tests
            </li>
            <li>Core extension words (incomplete)
            </li>
            <li>The Double Number word set and extensions
            </li>
            <li>The Exception word set and extensions
            </li>
            <li>The File-Access word set and extensions
            </li>
            <li>The Memory-Allocation word set
            </li>
            <li>The Programming-Tools word set and extensions (incomplete - a
            few words in each)
            </li>
            <li>The Search-Order word set and extensions
            </li>
            <li>The String word set
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The download also includes this file as readme.html
          </p>
          <p>
            The tests are not comprehensive, no claim is made about their being
            correct and no warranty is provided. However they have been run
            successfully with such widely used systems as GForth, VFX Forth,
            SwiftForth and Win32 Forth, any failing tests being due to the
            Forth system rather than the tests themselves.
          </p>

            Download
          </h2>
          <p>
            Version 0.9, 1 April 2012, <a href=
            "anstests0.9.zip">anstests0.9.zip</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            See the file changes.txt for a summary of the changes to the tests.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Running the tests
          </h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Unzip the files into a suitable directory
            </li>
            <li>Start the Forth system and set the working directory/file path
            to that directory
            </li>
            <li>Possibly edit the file paths in the file runtests.fth
            </li>
            <li>Select either tester.fr or ttester.fs by commenting out the
                unwanted file. Note that tester.fr is better for developing a
                new Forth system whereas ttester.fs is more suited for regression
                testing of an existing system.
            </li>
            <li>Include the file runtests.fth to run all the tests
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            There is a flag, called VERBOSE, in file tester.fr that can be set
            to obtain more output from the test programs. When a test fails an
            error message is displayed and the tests carry on. To stop on the
            first failure uncomment the line marked *** in tester.fr
          </p>
          <h2>
            Error Messages
          </h2>
          <p>
            There are two possible error messages when a test fails:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>"WRONG NUMBER OF RESULTS:" when the stack depth is wrong
            </li>
            <li>"INCORRECT RESULT:" when the stack contents are incorrect
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Both are followed by the offending line of source code.
          </p>

          <p>
            The output from running the tests under GForth 0.7.0 using
            tester.fr with the VERBOSE flag clear are:

            As can be seen GForth fails one test.
          </p>
          <p>
            The output will differ for different Forth systems, e.g. warnings
            of redefinitions, error messages and display of the search order.
