Record of changes to the ANS Forth test suite from version 0.9 onwards

Version 0.9 1 April 2012
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All test programs placed in the public domain.

All tests work with both tester.fr and ttester.fs

coreplustest.fth
   - multiple ELSE's in an IF statement
   - DO +LOOP tests with large increments
   - Ackermann function test for RECURSE added
   - >IN manipulation in interpreter mode
   - immediate CONSTANTs, VARIABLEs and CREATEd words tested
   - recursive :NONAME definitions moved to core extension test file
   - parsing behaviour of S" ." and ( tested

coreexttest.fth
   - SAVE-INPUT and RESTORE-INPUT tests modified to work with ttester.fs
   - CONVERT test deleted, obsolete word removed from Forth 200X
   - immediate VALUEs tested
   - recursive :NONAME tests added
   - PARSE and .( tests added
   - Parsing behaviour of C" tested

doubletest.fth
   - immediate 2CONSTANTs and 2VARIABLEs tested

memorytest.fth
   - Definition of CHECKMEM modified to work with ttester.fs

toolstest.fth
   - Further tests on [IF] [ELSE] [THEN]

Version 0.8
~~~~~~~~~~~
   - Tests added to stringtests.fth

Version 0.7
~~~~~~~~~~~
   - Includes a readme.html.
   - Name changes to avoid redefinition warnings.

Version 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~
   - corrected the case of some words to ensure the tests will run on a
     case-sensitive system

Version 0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~
   - includes a correction to the file-access tests.

Version 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~
   - to make some tests independent of cell size
   - to use T{ and }T instead of { and } as the test words. This avoids
     a clash with the Forth 200X use of { and } for Locals.
